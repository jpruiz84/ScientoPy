Both merits of degenerated PGA and operational amplifier based PGA are synthesized in proposed PGA. It is implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS process and draws 290pA current from a supply of 1.8V when driving a capacitor load of 2p at the IF of 1MHz, while high SR up to 2.2 x 10(7) V/s is obtained. OIP3 of 40dBm is achieved under all gain modes due to the constant loop bandwidth. Proposed PGA has a gain range from 0dB to 14dB at the step of 2dB. The THD reaches 72.7dB at the frequency of 1MHz when proposed PGA outputs a 1.3Vpp differential voltage signal.

Key features included in Bluetooth Specification version 4.1 are the ability for a single node to be part of multiple piconets, and the ability for a node to act dual mode, as both a piconet master and slave. These features allow the possibility of multi-hop routing spanning multiple connected piconets. Although multi-hop routing is theoretically possible with version 4.1, no multi-hop routing algorithm has never been presented which exploits this possibility. In this paper we propose an approach to scatternet formation and multi-hop routing for networks using BLE version 4.1. We define procedures for device discovery, communication between piconets and forming multi-hop scatternet. Our approach has the following properties, 1) it can be used with existing Bluetooth hardware, 2) the protocol is fully distributed, so global connectivity information is not required for formation and routing, and 3) it supports ad-hoc network formation. We have implemented our approach using real Bluetooth SoCs including the Broadcom BCM434x chipset which is used in the iPhone 6. Our experiments demonstrate the routing delay and throughput using networks containing different numbers of nodes in order to demonstrate the impact of network size on performance. As the network size increases, our protocol does not incur a large delay and achieves better resource utilization.

This solution forms part of an ambulatory monitoring system for patients with related heart diseases like arrhythmia, hypertension and diabetes, giving a more close interaction between patients and doctors. The hardware is based on the MSP430F5419A microcontroller, the CC2540 Bluetooth Low Energy (both from Texas Instruments), and the SIM908 GSM/GPRS/GPS modem from Simcom. The real time operating system FreeRTOS was used in the firmware. QRS complexes are detected and processed in the ECG wave signal; blood pressure and glucose level are processed as well. A robust communication protocol was implemented and an easy graphical user interface also. A total of 50 different samples were uploaded to the website using developed prototypes in a safety way.

This trend is not only ongoing, it is further pushed by developments in the area of software stacks like the latest Bluetooth Low Energy Stack. It is also pushed by new chip-designs and powerful and highly integrated electronic hardware. The acceptance of wireless technologies as a possible solution for industrial applications, has overcome the entry barrier [1]. The first step to see wireless as standard for many industrial applications is almost accomplished. Nevertheless there is nearly none acceptance of wireless technology for Safety applications. One highly challenging and demanding requirement is still unsolved: The aspect safety and robustness. Those topics have been addressed in many cases but always in a similar manner. WirelessHART as an example addresses this topic with redundant so called multiple propagation paths and frequency hopping to handle with interferences and loss of network participants. So far the pure peer to peer link is rarely investigated and there are less safety solutions available. One product called LoRa T can be seen as one possible solution to address this lack of safety within wireless links. This paper focuses on the safety performance evaluation of a modem-chip-design. The use of diverse and redundant wireless technologies like LoRa can lead to an increase acceptance of wireless in safety applications. Many measurements in real industrial application have been carried out to be able to benchmark the new chip in terms of the safety aspects. The content of this research results can help to raise the level of confidence in wireless. In this paper, the term "safety" is used for data transmission reliability.

The floor plan is modeled as a combination of links and open space polygons that are connected by nodes. In the authors' earlier work the link transition probabilities in this graph are proportional to the total link lengths that are the total lengths of the subgraphs accessible by choosing the considered link option, and this article extends this model to include open space polygons as well. A particle filter using the extended motion model in which all particles are constrained according to the map structure is presented. Furthermore, wireless local area network and Bluetooth Low Energy positioning tests show that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison methods especially if the measurement rate is low.

The features of BLE such as low-cost and low-power dominates it over other technologies such ZigBee, etc. The BLE 4.0 standard provides the in-depth analysis of the BLE architecture. But still many aspects regarding the discovery process of the BLE needs refinement. The performance evaluation of the classical Bluetooth analysis is widely studied, but it cannot apply to the BLE 4.0 standard. Several schemes have been proposed in this regard, but none of them provides the complete discovery process analysis. Therefore, in this paper we provide a complete, new, and an accurate discovery process of BLE standard. The intensive analytical and simulation study provide a basis for the modeling of the BLE discovery process. Moreover, the proposed analysis investigates discovery probability as well as expected discovery latency in a wireless sensor network based on BLE, which are then validated via extensive experiments. We also investigate different parameters which directly affect the performance of the BLE discovery process. The parameters settings are examined, and an optimal setting is also proposed for low-power consumption during the discovery process.

We assume a scenario with an energy-constrained transmitter and a constraint-free infrastructure, which allows us to introduce additional signal processing at the receiving side while keeping the transmitter intact. A novel approach of applying iterative decoding techniques to the BLE CRC code is investigated in this work. By using these techniques and real BLE packets collected in an office environment, we show that by enabling CRC error correction, the sensitivity of the BLE receiver can be improved by up to 3 dB. At the same time, up to 60% of corrupted packets can be corrected, which directly translates to a significant reduction in the number of retransmissions and a noticeable energy saving.

We start by introducing two orthogonally polarised antennas at the receiver, thus improving the probability of successful reception. This is followed by enabling error correction using redundancy introduced by the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code of BLE. The CRC error correction is based on a novel approach of applying iterative decoding algorithms. We then consider a BLE system deployed in a residential environment and utilise the presence of multiple receivers that are necessary to provide coverage. These three techniques come at no cost for the transmitter, thus preserving its energy efficiency. The final technique deals with error control coding in the application layer, in which some redundancy is added at the transmitter before data is sent to the physical layer. By combining all four methods, a distributed error correction algorithm is developed. Using real BLE packets collected in a typical 2-storey house, it is shown that the designed system can correct 80% of all corrupted packets.

Researchers have addressed the problem of automatic floor map construction in indoor environments using various modalities, such as inertial sensors, Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting and video cameras. Considering that some of these techniques are unavailable or impractical to implement in residential environments, in this paper, we focus on using RF signals to predict the number of walls between a wearable device and an access point. Using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on two data sets; a system-level data set of Bluetooth packets, and measurements on the signal attenuation, we construct wall prediction models that yield up to 91% identification rate. As a proof-of-concept, we also use the wall prediction models to infer the floor plan of a smart home deployment in a real residential environment.

Indeed, many products have been released that aim to find lost objects using the received signal strength indication (RSSI). However, these products do not provide sufficiently accurate location information to find objects. In this paper, we propose an active RFID attached object clustering method based on RSSI series for finding lost objects. This approach to find lost objects does not execute existing localization methods. We hypothesize that users can deduce the location of a lost object from information about surrounding objects in an environment where RFID tags are attached to all personal belongings. To help find lost objects from the proximity between RFID tags, the system calculates the proximity between a pair of RFID tags from the RSSI series, and estimates the groups of objects in the neighborhood. We present a method for calculating the proximity of the lost object to those around it using a distance function between RSSI series and estimating the group by hierarchical clustering. We confirm the validity of the proposed method, and determine the most appropriate pairs of four distance functions and four clustering algorithms. From the experimental results, it is apparent that our method provides a clear advantage in finding lost objects at low financial and installation cost, and can estimate groups accurately even if the smartphone or RSSI sensor is moving quickly.

We present Tracko, a 3D tracking system between two or more commodity devices without added components or device synchronization. Tracko achieves this by fusing three signal types. 1) Tracko infers the presence of and rough distance to other devices from the strength of Bluetooth low energy signals. 2) Tracko exchanges a series of inaudible stereo sounds and derives a set of accurate distances between devices from the difference in their arrival times. A Kalman filter integrates both signal cues to place collocated devices in a shared 3D space, combining the robustness of Bluetooth with the accuracy of audio signals for relative 3D tracking. 3) Tracko incorporates inertial sensors to refine 3D estimates and support quick interactions. Tracko robustly tracks devices in 3D with a mean error of 6.5 cm within 0.5 m and a 15.3 cm error within 1 m, which validates Trackoffs suitability for cross-device interactions.

The underlying phenomenon is that the off-center BLE antenna and asymmetric radio frequency topology create a characteristic Bluetooth RSSI distribution around the device. By comparing the real-time RSSI readings against a RSSI distribution model, each device can derive the relative position of the other adjacent device. Our experiments using an iPhone and iPad Mini show that Corona yields position estimation at 50% accuracy within a 2cm range, or 85% for the best two candidates. We developed an application to combine Corona with accelerometer readings to mitigate ambiguity and enable cross-device interactions on adjacent devices.

As more and more wearable devices emerge, unauthorized monitoring and tracking by adversary becomes great privacy threats not only in the cyberworld, but also in the physical world. To protect location privacy, this paper presents a real-life location monitoring system that is based on BLE privacy feature that changes the device physical address periodically. To enable users to better control their privacy level while still providing monitoring and tracking service to authorized parties (e.g., for child and elderly care), we extend BLE privacy by enriching its privacy semantics with a comprehensive set of metrics, such as simple opt-in/out, k-anonymity, and granularity-based anonymity. The system has been implemented and evaluated in terms of accuracy and user study.

However, it doesn't work well in indoor environments because it requires the line of sight to the satellites and therefore stops working when the line of sight is not available. High-precision indoor localization is critical to many personal and business applications. After Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an energy-efficient version of Bluetooth, is widely deployed, Bluetooth-based indoor localization turns out to be a practical method to locate Bluetooth-enabled devices due to its low battery cost. In this paper, we present two novel BLE-based localization schemes, Low-precision Indoor Localization (LIL) and High-precision Indoor Localization (HIL). Different than most of the existing localization methods that attempt to find the specific location of the object under investigation, LIL and HIL utilize the collected RSSI measurements to generate a small region in which the object is guaranteed to be found. Compared with LIL, HIL leads to smaller localization regions. However, HIL requires an extra data-training phase.

With proper input matching, this structure is shown to provide a reasonable power gain and superior linearity and efficiency in comparison to other low-power topologies. This is shown to be due to the low dependency of the power gain to the transistor transconductance and the low-voltage variations across the gate-source capacitance. This power amplifier is suitable for low-power and short-range applications such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Based on the calculated S-parameters, the operation frequency of this amplifier and its design trade-offs are presented, along with a comparison with competitive topologies. The design is simulated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology, operates with a 1.2 V supply, and provides a power gain of 8.5 dB with a DC power consumption of 3.6 mW. The input 1-dB compression point is 2.2 dBm, yielding a power added efficiency of 43%.

Wireless positioning is a key enabler for location based services and many research papers have been published for indoor positioning using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZIGBEE, IR etc. The published research suggests that position of wireless beacon can be determined based on the time of arrival and the measured signal strength. But, the margins of error in the calculated value using the published formulae, negatively impacts the efficacy of most indoor positioning applications. This paper recommends methods to improve the accuracy of the calculated value when using Bluetooth LE technology Methods used for Indoor positioning as compared to Outdoor positioning need to handle attenuation factors such as Multipath fading, diffraction, reflection etc. These become especially critical for short ranges of similar to 3m which is the general range of influence for a display unit. Hence, modelling a very short range Path Loss Prediction becomes imperative. This paper proposes a new Path Loss model for very short range between 10-12 ft with better accuracy and miniscule error rate.

In most of the existing routing techniques in wireless networks assumes that all nodes are static and do not change their positions till the end of the network. Although it is not a realistic assumption, it eliminates the effects of mobility of nodes in routing the data. In this paper, we present a mesh network for mobile devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We propose a weight balancing technique to optimize the communication for routing the data using BLE mesh network. We develop a prototype of BLE mesh network using the Android operating system.

In order to reduce the energy consumption of the wireless sensor with continuous data collecting, a strategy of data transmission for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is proposed in this paper. The method aims to cut down the transmission average current by changing the size of sensor data packet (packaged with different numbers of data unit) in the same sampling frequency of sensors. Two commonly-used Bluetooth 4.0 chips, CC2541 and nRF51822 were compared in this experiment and the result shows that the average current of data transmission reduced obviously by the packaging strategy. This method makes the wireless wearable devices based on BLE become more suitable for the continuous data collection system.

The system includes all the elements of the data acquisition chain. The MEMS device is interfaced by a capacitance-to-digital converter for signal conditioning, and a microcontroller associated to a radio for both data processing and transmitting. Moreover a specific housing has been designed with trade consideration, including a Porex((R)) microporous polymer membrane for moisture protection. Finally, a dedicated graphic user interface has been implemented with assisted calibration or recording procedures, and an oscilloscope for data monitoring.

In indoor positioning method, fingerprinting is better than trilateration in that it is possible to avoid problems that are not effectively applied to indoor wireless attenuation model. Fingerprinting compares the radio propagation condition that is measured at the time of positioning with the set of radio propagation conditions that are measured in initial training, and estimates the position according to its similarity. However, since radio waves are superimposed by the reflection of the walls and floors in the indoor environment, positioning accuracy decreases when the layout of the environment is changed after creation of the initial training data. To solve this problem, we propose a method to infer whether some obstacle exists between each pair of transmitter and receiver by principal component analysis of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of multi-frequency, to detect LOS (Line-of-Sight)-shielded transmitters and to eliminate them from calculation for positioning. Comparing with existing method on typical fingerprinting, our method improved up to 31% on robustness.

The developed posture monitoring system obtains the orientation in space of each body segment in which the sensor nodes are placed and calculates the trunk angle, the knee angle and the angle of inclination of the road. Raw sensor data are collected periodically from accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes and sent via BLE to an Android smartphone, which plays the role of central station and performs the data processing concerning the posture calculation. We describe the development of the hardware and software of the sensor nodes, which are based on the CC2540 BLE system-on-chip, as well as the development of the Android application, and provide experimental results concerning the measurement of the posture of a cyclist in order to validate the proposed system.

In order to reduce the complexity and cost of the application development, we propose a device-independent formalization of the pass-by rendezvous of mobile entities in this paper. Specifically, we first define a pass-by rendezvous as a phenomenon, where two mobile entities are closed enough at a certain time. We then derive four properties from the definition to be satisfied within any pass-by systems. The properties allow indirect pass-by rendezvous between mobile entities with different devices. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two different practical systems (Bluetooth Low Energy and GPS). In the case study, we see how the pass-by rendezvous can be implemented in each system, and see how the indirect rendezvous across the two systems can be inferred using the proposed properties.

Almost all Bluetooth slaves are battery-powered so that they should connect with a master through the device discovery for a short time. To prevent the worst case scenario with long device discovery in Bluetooth, the events with long device discovery should be estimated in advance. However, it is intractable to estimate the exact longest device discovery time with Monte Carlo simulations or mathematical analysis because of the probabilistic behavior. In this paper, we reveal the longest device discovery time and the maximum energy consumption in Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) with a probabilistic model checking tool, PRISM. The results show that some parameters in Bluetooth LE will largely affect the energy consumption so that their design criteria will be desired to reduce the energy consumption.

We fabricated a detecting circuit for the force/pressure sensor which uses a Bluetooth low energy module and which is powered by a coin cell battery. The circuit enables mounting the detecting circuit on a glove. In addition, we developed a user interface application which is easy to use and which records the information on abdominal palpations on a personal computer.

In general those devices need to be connected to a computer to function properly. Moreover, applications that project images on such an HMD respond typically only to user inputs like mouse and keyboard actions and head movement. In this paper we go a step further by proposing a framework in which the movements of a person are translated into actions in a virtual world. This allows a user to walk around freely while wearing an HMD, increasing the reality of the virtual experience. We will focus in detail on the challenges related to the localization of the user and discuss different options like existing wireless localization technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and an object recognition algorithm. The latter is used in the final solution. Furthermore, we present an experimental and mobile setup to use an HMD in a portable manner. Our solution is demonstrated through a multiplayer game, in which two players compete against each other to capture a flag.

We first use extensive measurement studies with multiple Android devices to establish that the BLE interface on current smartphones is not as "low-energy" as nominally expected, and establish that continuous use of such a BLE interface is not feasible unless we choose a moderately large scan interval and a low duty cycle. We then explore the implications of such constraints, on the parameters of a smartphone's BLE stack, on the accuracy of a BLE-based indoor localization techniques. We show that while RF-based indoor location can be highly accurate (80% of estimates have errors less than or equal to 4 meters) for stationary users only if the density of beacons is high, the combination of (large scan interval, low duty cycle) causes the location error to degrade significantly for moving users. These results provide practical insights into the use cases and limitations for future BLE-based mobile services.

But managing a large-scale beacon infrastructure presents new systems challenges, including managing battery life, replacing misplaced or stolen beacons, detecting and locating foreign or malicious beacons, and engineering beacon locations to optimize wireless resources. We study two problems whose solutions facilitate large-scale beacon network management. First, we develop a prototype system to demonstrate how conventionally static beacon advertisements can be made time-varying, and argue that time-varying advertisements can convey important device health and network state information. We then consider a fundamental question in site engineering; calculating upper limits on the spatial density of deployed beacons to optimize either the number of advertisements received, or mobile users reached. Using analysis and simulation, we show that with current wireless standards beacon separation should be at least 0.5 meters per advertisement channel. Knowledge of this bound facilitates the construction of topology design rules, and quantifies previously unknown limits on beacon density in ultra-dense deployments.

Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a shopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time and can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the most widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is the fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The clear advantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a multitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API) level, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface. However, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for largescale floor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit a huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the localization is intended to be done on mobile devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) which have limited memory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation method, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method. The trade-off is however paid in terms of a lower accuracy than the one obtained with traditional fingerprinting with Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates. In this paper a novel K-means -based method for floor estimation via fingerprint clustering of WiFi and various other positioning sensor outputs is introduced. Our method achieves a floor estimation accuracy close to the one with NN fingerprinting, while significantly improves the complexity and the speed of the floor detection algorithm. The decrease in the database size is achieved through storing and transmitting only the cluster heads (CH's) and their corresponding floor labels. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using reallife indoor measurements taken from four multi-floor buildings. The numerical results show that the proposed K-means -based method offers an excellent trade-off between the complexity and performance.

However to correlate the diverse data from distributed sensor nodes possess a huge challenge in terms of defining a global time in the network and thereby generates a demand for time synchronization in the network. Before employing time synchronization in such a CPS based network it is required to carefully consider number of parameters including precision, security, reliability, processing time, memory requirement and energy costs. In this paper an energy-efficient clock synchronization method using two-way message exchange protocol which was recently proposed and theoretically proved namely pairwise-broadcast synchronization (PBS) and another similar method called timing-sync protocol for sensor networks (TPSN) were implemented. For this purpose a novel autarkic hardware pair was designed to enable the interoperability with existing infrastructure. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) medium was taken into consideration to ease the medical certification procedure and low power consumption. An experimental evaluation of the methods focusing on their reproducibility, precision, and performance overhead was discussed.

A lot of work has been done in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in recent years. Efforts to make efficient, low cost, scalable and easily deployable WSN have been on going. In order to reduce cost and improve life of a sensor node, it is necessary to optimize battery usage and power consumption. This paper looks at BLE as a potential candidate to reduce power in IOTWSN. BLE based activity detection is also incorporated into the system to avoid power wastage in real-time monitoring. The power consideration of the proposed architecture is compared to existing wireless technologies used in WSN.

This service uses beacon modules emitting radio waves based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and provides automatic triggering of a single notification from a beacon module to multiple smartphones at proximity. In usual iBeacon systems, there is one-to-one correspondence between notification and beacon module. However, if we introduce a memory to remember the history of iBeacon detection, iBeacon systems can be extended to handle multiple notifications by multiple beacon modules with awareness of some contexts of pedestrians' moving directions, which enables a guide, for example, to the exit of buildings. We explain this idea for indoor route guidance using iBeacon and discuss its implementation with our simple experiment and performance evaluation.

Existing higher capacity link (e.g., Bluetooth Classic, WiFi) however requires high connection setup cost. To deal with this dilemma, we propose to bundle multiple data transmission requests and send the aggregated data at once to reduce energy consumption for link setup. Where the concept of bundling has been widely used for cloud storage services, existing schemes do not consider energy efficiency. In this paper, we present three bundling algorithms that try to balance the reduction of energy consumption and the extension of delivery delay by adapting to the current data request pattern. We perform extensive evaluation by using the realistic parameters that are obtained via experimental measurements by using a latest commercial smart watch.

In this paper, Smart Fall is presented. It is a new accelerometer-based fall detection system integrated into an intelligent building. The developed system consists of two main components. Fall detection is realized inside a small customized wearable device that is characterized by low costs and low-energy consumption. Additionally, a receiver component is implemented which serves as mediator between the wearable device and a Smart Home environment. The wireless connection between the wearable and the receiver is performed by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. OpenHAB is used as platform-independent integration platform that connects home appliances vendor- and protocol-neutral. The integration of the fall detection system into an intelligent home environment offers quick reactions to falls and urgent support for fallen people.

Such networks are being increasingly used to acquire sensory data that need to be processed in real-time. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is an attractive solution for implementing personal area networks with reduced energy consumption, also because it is supported by consumer devices such as tablets and smart phones; however, it cannot guarantee a bounded delay for managing real-time traffic. This paper overcomes such a limitation by presenting a bandwidth sharing mechanism that allows partitioning the available network bandwidth between the BLE and another user-defined protocol built on top of the raw radio transceiver. Experimental results are also reported to characterize the timing behavior of the dual protocol on a specific platform.

In this context, the Smart Homes are getting more and more attention, since people are very attracted by the idea of a home environment able to automatically meet their needs. However, the heterogeneity of the smart devices, the difficulty in automating the user-home interaction, and the poor involvement of the users in the development process of new services and applications still represent very debated issues. So, in this paper, we propose an architecture able to overcome the heterogeneity of smart devices and that can be easily extended to new future technologies. To maximize the User Experience, the proposed architecture automatically manages the environment basing on users-defined rules and on people movements, by exploiting an indoor location service based on Bluetooth Low Energy. Finally, the system also provides a simplified development tool that allows even common users to develop new services for Smart Homes and mobile applications to directly interact with the home environment. As a proof-of-concept, the first development steps are described in this paper.

PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" x 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws less than 180 mW itself, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1,000 units.

In this paper, we present the Acoustic Location Processing System (ALPS), a platform that augments BLE transmitters with ultrasound in a manner that improves ranging accuracy and can help users configure indoor localization systems with minimal effort. A user places three or more beacons in an environment and then walks through a calibration sequence with their mobile device where they touch key points in the environment like the floor and the corners of the room. This process automatically computes the room geometry as well as the precise beacon locations without needing auxiliary measurements. Once configured, the system can track a user's location referenced to a map. The platform consists of time-synchronized ultrasonic transmitters that utilize the bandwidth just above the human hearing limit, where mobile devices are still sensitive and can detect ranging signals. To aid in the mapping process, the beacons perform inter-beacon ranging during setup. Each beacon includes a BLE radio that can identify and trigger the ultrasonic signals. By using differences in propagation characteristics between ultrasound and radio, the system can classify if beacons are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) to the mobile phone. In cases where beacons are blocked, we show how the phone's inertial measurement sensors can be used to supplement localization data. We experimentally evaluate that our system can estimate three-dimensional beacon location with a Euclidean distance error of 16.1cm, and can generate maps with room measurements with a two-dimensional Euclidean distance error of 19.8cm. When tested in six different environments, we saw that the system can identify Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals with over 80% accuracy and track a user's location to within less than 100cm.

To make the operation of RPL over BLE feasible, we design an adaptation layer between BLE and RPL, termed ALBER. Specifically, we develop three technical features in ALBER which enable BLE to be combined with RPL. First, it broadcasts RPL control messages through BLE using advertising channels with low energy consumption. Second, it updates RPL routing table considering connection management of BLE. Lastly, it estimates link quality based on round trip time of link layer ping packets to provide routing metric for RPL. We implement our ALBER on Linux kernel. This demo will present an operation example of RPL over BLE using ALBER in a small scale multi-hop topology, where each node comprises a Raspberry Pi platform and a BLE dongle.

We present a set of these pieces, including a gateway, four hardware building blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an indoor localization system, and software for connecting users and devices. Each piece plays an integral role towards enabling applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of components. By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit offers cohesive support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric applications-typical in today's IoT landscape-and towards richer applications that incorporate multiple data streams, human interaction, cloud processing, location awareness, multiple communication protocols, historical data, access control, and on-demand user interfaces. To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting, but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

This paper focuses on investigating the usage of electromyography and galvanic skin response to detect the driver fatigue symptoms. The study reveals that the variation of EMG signal patterns can be mapped to simulate the driving behavior. In the study, five attachment positions of EMG sensors are observed to indicate the best position of the mapping for wheel steering control behavior. Hereby, the study also reveals that the changing variations of EMGs in frequency-domain are excellent and significant fatigue indicator than the usual time-domain features. On the other hand, existing systems only focused on analyzing the signal pattern of GSR, but not the variation of GSR in accordance to frequency analysis, which is one of our main objectives study. The sensed EMGs and GSRs are transmitted to the mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy. The analysis takes part in mobile device with implemented fatigue monitoring application. If the developed classifier indicates the driver vigilance level dropped to dangerous pre-defined threshold, a vibration warning will be triggered to alert the driver. In fact, the experiment results revealed that the significant differences in EMG and GSR features are managed to determine the driver fatigue in five seconds interval. The developed SVM classifier of mobile application shows average of 92% fatigue detection accuracy rate.

We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN.

It addresses the whole pipeline from data acquisition over data processing to data visualization including wearable integration. ECG signals are recorded with a novel ECG sensor supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, which is able to transmit raw ECG data as well as estimated heart rate. ECG signals are processed in real-time on a mobile device to automatically classify the user's heart beats. A novel application for Android-based mobile devices was developed for data visualization. It offers several modes for cardiac feedback, from measuring the current heart rate to continuously monitoring the user's heart status. It also allows to store acquired data in an internal database as well as in the Google Fit platform. Further, the application provides extensions for wearables like Google Glass and smartwatches running on Android Wear. Hardware performance evaluation was performed by comparing the course of heart rate between the novel ECG sensor and a commercial ECG sensor. The mean absolute error between the two sensors was 4.83 bpm with a standard deviation of 4.46 bpm, and a Pearson correlation of 0.922. A qualitative evaluation was performed for the Android application with special emphasis on the daily usability and the wearable integration. When the Google Glass was integrated, the subjects rated the application as 2.8/5 (0 = Bad, 5 = Excellent), whereas when the application was integrated with a smartwatch the rating increased to 4.2/5.

The sensors are omnipresent - in smartphones, smartwatches, and smartglasses and even in the environment around us in the form of peer smartphones or even infrastructure sensors such as bluetooth low energy beacons. However, there are various challenges pertaining to the sensor data processing, which makes creation of activities of daily life tracker challenging. In this work, we discuss about some of these challenges. We also discuss about some ADL tracking systems that we have developed and how we have addressed some of the challenges in building these systems.

For these cases, an in-vehicle router is important because in-vehicle devices communicate with the external server via the in-vehicle router. The in-vehicle router activates devices outside the vehicle as necessary and maintain a stable speed for the in-vehicle devices. We proposed two methods to reduce the inaccurate activation of wireless devices and improve the throughput for in-vehicle wireless communication. The proposed methods were evaluated through field tests. These results showed that the probability of false positives was reduced and the throughput for each passenger was improved for each vehicle. These two methods were integrated into one system, and the system was used to provide appropriate information only for users who visited a destination.

Although there is some similarity to the original definition, the low energy version works upon some fundamentally different RF coding principles and parameters. Bluetooth low energy can also serve for linking sports and health sensors to personal, ubiquitous devices like smartphones - a mode that is already provided by yet another communication standard, which is called ANT+. The latter was invented and introduced some years earlier as common standard for enabling interoperation of sports consumer devices, and it was implemented as well into certain smartphone product branches of several famous vendors. Focusing the application in personal sports and health care, the two competing concepts are evaluated and compared in this investigation here. Especially the technical features and their impact on design structures and implementation efforts are discussed on base of a particular, quite typical sample application scenario.

In healthcare, various companies have been offering real time location system solutions to hospitals with great success. These systems are used for asset management, workflow improvement as well as patient and staff tracking. For test runs we decided on a low-cost location tracking system based on proximity detection and the technology Bluetooth Low Energy. The system was developed for the use in OR environments which comes with specific requirements. The goal of this work is to evaluate if people with Bluetooth Low Energy tags are reliably tracked and detected. These tests were conducted in the first stages of a development phase to see, how the tracking system behaved in a controlled office environment. Problems such as the inactivity of the tag and random changes into other nearby rooms because of multipath effects arise and are discussed.

One of the biggest challenges in indoor location systems is to determine the actual indoor position of the user using a smart device (Phone, PC, etc...), due to their instability, cost, high-power consumption, low accuracy and low precision. To overcome those problems, we have designed, implemented and emulated an indoor location system based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE). BLE 4.0 technology is more advantageous in terms of long life expectancy; our approach is based on the deployment of equidistant nodes on the ceiling. The nodes are programmed to broadcast a periodic beacon at a time-pace of 400ms and then to enter sleep mode. When a smart device enters within the broadcasting range, it locates the three access points (nodes) with the highest signal strength. This information can be calculated using one of the several localization algorithms (Trilateration). The proposed Trilateration algorithm can be easily implemented in the hardware due to its low complexity; the method can be successful even when using a few numbers of nodes. In average the system has about 0.5 similar to 1 meters of error.

In particular, we focus on the application-level and analyze the performance of different BLE modules when interfaced with a smartphone in single- and multi-slave configurations. Data throughput and power consumption are evaluated in relation to the parameters of the protocol and we present to the reader useful guidelines for an optimal integration of BLE in devices with data streaming capabilities.

An estimation technique using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) tags becomes most attractive and promising among other techniques for estimating location because a majority of smartphones supports BLE. The BLE tags transmit advertisement (ADV) packets periodically, which include a unique ID related to each tag. When a smartphone receives the ADV packet, the smartphone sends a query to the server to retrieve the location-based information for the ID. To provide such a service continuously, operators have to monitor whether BLE tags work well and repair them in the event of a problem. These operations are difficult because they require physical labor that cannot be automated for a large number of BLE tags spread over a wide area. Therefore, we evaluated the operations of BLE tags quantitatively by the metric of operational costs. We established an environment composed of 54 BLE tags in a four-story building and measured the lifetime of the battery, the service availability ratio, and the operational costs. Through the experiments, we obtained various results regarding the battery management of the BLE tags and the effectiveness of redundant deployment.

In this work, we present a wearable device for physical and emotional health monitoring. The device obtains user's key physiological signals: ECG, respiration, Impedance Cardiogram (ICG), blood pressure and skin conductance and derives the user's emotion states as well. We have developed embedded algorithms that process the bio-signals in real-time to detect any abnormalities (cardiac arrhythmias and morphology changes) in the ECG and to detect key parameters (such as the Pre- Ejection Period and fluid status level) from the ICG. We present a novel method to detect continuous beat-by-beat blood pressure from the ECG and ICG signals, as well as a real-time embedded emotion classifier that computes the emotion levels of the user Emotions are classified according to their attractiveness (positive valence) or their averseness (negative valence) in the horizontal valence dimension. The excitement level induced by the emotions is represented by high to low positions in the vertical arousal dimension of the valence-arousal space. The signals are measured either intermittently by touching the metal electrodes on the device (for point-of-care testing) or continuously, using a chest strap for long term monitoring. The processed data from device is sent to a mobile phone using a Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. Our results show that the device can monitor the signals continuously, providing accurate detection of the motion state, for over 72 hours on a single battery charge.

In Taiwan, 51.9 percent of the elderly over 45 years old need rehabilitation and the demand of wearing orthoses aids in the aging of society has increased significantly. Physicians don't know the rehabilitation effectiveness and the patient compliance behaviors and related factors of the disease until the patients come back to the clinic. It will affect the diagnosis accuracy. In Taiwan, there isn't a continuous spin care after a patient goes to clinic. Therefore, in the study, we cooperate with orthopedics department of Mackay Memorial Hospital Hsinchu Branch to plan a continuous spin care service based on an iBrace monitor system with BLE (Blue Low Energy). iBrace integrates EMG, pressure sensors and position sensors and APP with cloud spine care service platform.

The main components are: i) RFID tags, ii) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and iii) smartphones. The core functions of the architecture are performed by two Android applications: the Asset Proximity Locator (APL) and the Wandering Objects Location Finder (WOLF). The key feature of the asset tracking function is the ability to maximize smartphone battery lifetime by switching on and off the GPS unit, thus guaranteeing that the smartphone can be used for an entire working shift. A detailed energy consumption analysis is carried out for each component of the architecture. The results achieved by simulations, concerning BLE tag detection probability, are presented and discussed.

Current approaches focus on the use of cloud-hosted backend services which allow file and app-state synchronization but fail in providing true resource sharing among mobile devices. To enable true resource/service sharing, the mobile devices of a single user should be combined into a cloud of cooperating mobile devices. Instead of accessing the resources/services of an individual device, a user should be able to seamlessly access the combined resources/services of his/her device cloud. Enabling seamless access to the resources/services hosted on different mobile devices is therefore a key challenge. Exposing the resources/services of each mobile devices within the user's device cloud via RESTful micro-services, is one possible approach. This paper focusses on the use of the IoT protocol CoAP as an application layer protocol. To minimize the energy costs of communication, it was necessary to replace CoAP's standard transport protocol (UDP) with BLE 4.1. This paper presents the performance of the CoAP protocol using BLE 4.1 on Android Lollipop.

Hearing Aid devices for Smart Cities: A Survey	2015 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL SMART CITIES CONFERENCE (ISC2)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE First International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)	OCT 25-28, 2015	Guadalajara, MEXICO			Hearing aid; bluetooth low energy; smart cities		Hearing loss population has increased in recent years. Hearing aid technology has evolved in the last decade but the percentage of users of such devices remains very low. With the advent of wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), along with the exponential growth of smart phone demand, it is expected an increment of the users of hearing aid devices due to the new use cases that BLE will create. In this contribution, we provide a survey of the existing technologies for hearing aid and their use cases. Because one of the key objectives of smart cities is the quality of life of their citizens, we explain how several hearing aid use cases can be applied in these scenarios.

Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide haptic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.

Providing pedestrians with accurate, reliable, cheap, low power consuming and continuously available positional data inside the buildings (i.e. indoors) where GNSS signals are not usually available is difficult. Several positioning technologies can be applied as stand-alone indoor positioning technologies. They include Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Tactile Floor (TF), Ultra Sound (US) and High Sensitivity GNSS (HSGNSS). This paper evaluates the practicality and fitness-to-the-purpose of pedestrian navigation for these stand-alone positioning technologies to identify the best one for the purpose of indoor pedestrian navigation. In this regard, the most important criteria defining a suitable positioning service for pedestrian navigation are identified and prioritised. They include accuracy, availability, cost, power consumption and privacy. Each technology is evaluated according to each criterion using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and finally the combination of all weighted criteria and technologies are processed to identify the most suitable solution.

Two pathloss models based on weighted centroids and non-negative least squares estimation are presented: one including a floor loss factor, and the other one ignoring the floor losses, and the three signal types are compared in terms of the path-loss parameters, channel fluctuations and positioning accuracy, namely the distance errors and floor detection probabilities. The comparison is done based on real-field measurement data collected from a university building in Tampere, Finland. It is shown that all these three signal types have similar shadowing variances and close path-loss parameter values, and that a path-loss model considering floor losses gives the best floor detection probability, but not necessarily the smallest distance error.

A well-established fingerprint database plays an important role in positioning, especially enhancing positioning accuracy. In literature, there are studies that consider only one type of measurements such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth RSS, but these values are not sufficient alone to overcome the problems in dynamically changed environments. In order to deal with this, we propose a novel fingerprint database that contains both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth RSS values in addition to magnetic field measurements obtained from mobile devices. In addition to this, the proposed database also contains Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RSS values obtained from preplaced sensor nodes in the experimental environment. The aims of this fingerprint database are to enhance accuracy, precision, and robustness of the location estimation system to dynamically changed environment and to satisfy researchers' needs who are deal with different problems in indoor positioning.

BALSA: Bluetooth Low Energy Application Layer Security Add-on	2015 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SECURE INTERNET OF THINGS (SIOT)			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 International Workshop on Secure Internet of Things (SIoT)	SEP 21-25, 2015	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Comp Soc				Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is ideally suited to exchange information between mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. It is supported by most recent consumer mobile devices and can be integrated into sensors enabling them to exchange information in an energy-efficient manner. However, when BLE is used to access or modify sensitive sensor parameters, exchanged messages need to be suitably protected, which may not be possible with the security mechanisms defined in the BLE specification. Consequently we contribute BALSA, a set of cryptographic protocols, a BLE service and a suggested usage architecture aiming to provide a suitable level of security. In this paper we define and analyze these components and describe our proof-of-concept, which demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of BALSA.

This paper addresses three essential aspects in attaining secure association for such devices. First, we define a user-interface primitive, oblivious comparison, that allows users to approve authentic associations and abort compromised ones. This distills and generalizes several existing approve/abort mechanisms, and moreover we experimentally show that OC can be implemented using very little hardware: one LED and one switch. Second, we provide a new Message Recognition Protocol (MRP) that allows devices associated using oblivious comparison to exchange authenticated messages without the use of public-key cryptography (which exceeds the capabilities of many IoT devices). This protocol improves upon previously proposed MRPs in several respects. Third, we propose a robust definition of security for MRPs that is based on universal composability, and show that our MRP protocol satisfies this definition.

Investigation into Off-Body Links for Wrist Mounted Antennas in Bluetooth Systems	2015 LOUGHBOROUGH ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION CONFERENCE (LAPC)			English	Proceedings Paper	Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference (LAPC)	NOV 02-03, 2015	Loughborough, UNITED KINGDOM			Indoor Propagation; Off-Body Link; Microstrip Patch; Monopole; Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); Bluetooth; Body-Shadow; Packet Error Rates	PATH-LOSS EXPONENT; JOINT ESTIMATION; NETWORKS; LOCATION; MODEL	This paper presents a detailed investigation into off-body links for wrist mounted Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices for an indoor environment and revolves around three low profile antennas (microstrip patch, printed monopole and external monopole). It studies the received signal strength across different usage scenarios and obstructions such as body shadow, wall and ceiling through measurement campaigns carried out in a 2-storey house. It is observed that RSSIs show little variation from the mean value at any position in a given room of the house. In the living room, the average RSSI for patch, printed and external monopole is close to -61,-73 and -61 dBm respectively. The study describes the effect of usual obstructions such as wall and ceiling to off-body links and shows that the range of RSSI for any antenna (30 dBm at P=0.5 for Patch Antenna) is bounded at one end by the CDF of wall plus body shadow and at the other end by CDF of Line of Sight (LOS). The effect of body shadowing is studied in greater detail. It is observed that the microstrip patch antenna in LOS, under a ceiling and behind a wall, drops by approximately 15dB, 5dB and 10dB at P=0.4 when it goes into body shadow. The study also suggests that the Access Point (AP) on the ceiling provides better off-body links as compared to it in the adjacent room. The study compares the overall performance of the three antennas across all possible usage scenarios, obstructions & polarizations and concludes that the external monopole and patch antenna performs better than printed monopole by approximately 10-13 dBm. Finally, the study shows the variation of Packet Error Rate (PER) with RSSI and determines threshold values of RSSI for acceptable PERs, for reliable and robust applications.

The vast majority of mild and moderate OSA patients are positional patients, which means that these patients show most of their breathing abnormalities while sleeping in supine position. For these patients positional therapy may be a simple and effective treatment solution. In this study we present a training system for positional patients to alert them when a SpO(2) desaturation is occurring, or when they spend a long period of time sleeping in supine position. The alert is given to the patient initially as a smooth vibration in their wrist band, but if the condition persists, a buzzer is used for auditory indication. The system uses an accelerometer on the chest or abdomen to determine the sleeping posture and a commercial finger clip pulse oximeter to monitor heart rate and SpO(2).

The ability to constantly monitor the patient's vital signs for abnormalities, in addition to alerting first responders to immediate problems, would allow for more rapid medical treatment. As the population of the United States ages, low-cost and ubiquitous medical devices will improve the ability of medical personnel to diagnose potential health issues early, thus increasing the survival rate and decreasing the potential complications. Electrocardiograms are a major focus of the medical community due to the prevalence of heart issues among elderly Americans, and as the cost of sensors and wireless communication decreases, new devices are possible. This paper describes a Bluetooth-based, dry electrode electrocardiogram monitoring system seamlessly integrated into a T-shirt. The shirt used three dry silver-based electrodes to collect the ECG signal and streamed the resulting signal to an Android smartphone for analysis.

As with new ideas that hold immense potential, the optimism of IoT has also exaggerated the underlying technologies well before they can mature into a sustainable ecosystem. While 6LoWPAN has emerged as a disruptive technology that brings IP capability to networks of resource constrained devices, a suitable radio technology for this device class is still debatable. In the recent past, Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 stack -has surfaced as an appealing alternative that provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets). When Bluetooth 4.0 was first released, it was not targeted for IP-connected devices but for communication between two neighboring peers. However, the latest release of Bluetooth 4.2 offers features that makes Bluetooth LE a competitive candidate among the available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space. In this paper, we discuss the novel features of Bluetooth LE and its applicability in 6LoWPAN networks.

The primary focus of research into such a theory is however, limited to solving the problem of localization accuracy. In this work, the motivation is to provide a solution to the current range limitations of an Indoor Position System (IPS) in the form of a framework "Cooperatively Applied Positioning Techniques Utilizing Range Extension (CAPTURE)". These range limitations are the culmination of well documented difficulties of localizing using wireless signals in such Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) environments. The coverage of a localization solution is still a new and challenging issue in the indoor environment. In this paper we implement a version of CAPTURE that uses Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE 4.0) that take advantage of mobile devices at the outer limits of an IPS to help extend its reach into blind spots, where devices cannot be currently located. CAPTURE is evaluated using a live test environment, where range estimations are recorded between cooperating devices. These range estimations are filtered before being placed into a positioning algorithm to locate lost devices. Finally the accuracy of CAPTURE is presented, demonstrating the achievable benefits of implementing CAPTURE as a solution to the problem of coverage in an Indoor environment.

Techniques based on signal surveys (fingerprint maps) are arguably the most prevalent today, but these rely on time-consuming, complex manual surveys of the signal propagation. Recently progress has been made in semi-automated surveying, where Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithms are combined with signal measurements using Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) techniques first developed in robotics. In this work we advocate the use of a dedicated surveyor whose trajectory is estimated using a SLAM based PDR corrected using magnetic signals. Magnetic signals are fast varying indoors, but have poor spatial locality. We show how to match sequences of magnetic measurements within a survey walk in order to identify loops in the trajectory for the SLAM algorithm. Having estimated a trajectory, we build WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal maps using Gaussian Processes regression. Magnetic maps are not used for positioning. We test our system in a range of testbeds. We find magnetic SLAM to estimate the trajectory of a 10 minute walk to high accuracy (average error of any point 73 cm, subjective-objective error 22 cm). The resultant signal maps are found to give good positioning accuracies within 3-4 m of the trajectory and come close to the manual survey accuracies, despite requiring significantly less manual effort. We believe our system offers a robust and easy way to survey an environment.

Limited device density and frequency hopping based communication usually eliminates the chances of mutual interference among independent Bluetooth piconets. However, with the advent of Internet of Things, there is a sharp increase in Bluetooth-equipped devices, especially in wearable devices. This gives raise to multiple collocated piconets, thus increasing the mutual interference leading to performance degradation of Bluetooth communication. In this work, we study the latency and energy consumption by Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices under the influence of mutual interference, which has not been studied in the literature. Based on the experimental results involving 32 BLE devices, we investigate the influence of mutual interference and develop models for energy consumption and latency. These models can be utilized in future BLE enabled devices.	[Treurniet, Jan Jaap; de Boer, Willem] Technolution BV, Gouda, Netherlands; [Sarkar, Chayan; Prasad, R.

However, the restriction of data communication topology to point-to-point, limited range of communications, and the lack of IP support make Bluetooth Low Energy less attractive for Internet of Things applications. In Dec. 2014, the Bluetooth SIG standardized the Internet Protocol Support Profile to support the exchanging of IPv6 packets between devices over Bluetooth Low Energy. Still, a mesh networking protocol for multi-hop support is needed for it to overcome the limitations due to short range and restricted topology. This paper introduces BLEmesh, a wireless mesh network protocol which utilizes the broadcasting capability of wireless transmissions. We identify the available data payload using Bluetooth Low Energy Generic Access Profile Non-connectable Advertisement Data for different number of nodes and packets to send in a batch. Then we compare BLEmesh with conventional routing method and flood routing method. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the number of transmissions by BLEmesh is significantly smaller compared to its competitors for some selected network configurations, reducing the aggregated energy consumption within the mesh network.

Many methods have been proposed for indoor positioning as well as navigation services. A big number of them were based on Radio frequency (RF) technology and Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for their simplicity of use. The main issues of the studies conducted in this field are related to the improvement of localization factors like accuracy, computational complexity, easiness of deployment and cost. In our study, we used Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for indoor localization in the context of a smart home where an elderly person can be located using an hybrid system that combines radio, light and sound information. In this paper, we propose a model that averages the received signal strength indication (RSSI) at any distance domain which offered accuracy down to 0.4 meters, depending on the deployment configuration	[Thaljaoui, Adel; Val, Thierry] Univ Toulouse, CNRS IRIT IRT, UT2J, Toulouse, France; [Nasri, Nejah] Univ Sfax, ENIS, LETI, Sfax, Tunisia; [Brulin, Damien] Univ Toulouse, LASS CNRS N2IS, UT2J, Toulouse, France	Thaljaoui, A (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS IRIT IRT, UT2J, Toulouse, France.

We consider the case when traditional error correction codes are not available due to energy constraints at the transmitter. Using the CRC-24 code adopted by the Bluetooth Low Energy standard as an example, we show how two iterative techniques traditionally used for decoding of low-density parity check codes Belief Propagation (BP) and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)- can be applied to the high-density parity check matrix of the code. The performance of both techniques is evaluated through simulation, and it is demonstrated that a gain of up to 1.7 dB in terms of the SNR per bit and a total reduction of the packet error rate by more than 70% can be achieved compared with the non-correction scenario, at no extra cost for the transmitter. We also compare the two techniques and use the standard syndrome look-up method as a benchmark.

This is of particular relevance when these technologies are deployed as part of capillary networks. The physical layer parameters of BLE and IEEE 802.11ah are modeled, together with a detailed and accurate indoor propagation scenario that accounts for wall losses, ray tracing multi-path, and diffractions. A real case office building scenario is considered for practical evaluation. The minimum density of BLE central devices and IEEE 802.11ah access points that guarantees a predetermined coverage level is derived and compared between the two technologies. It is shown that BLE requires five times the number of central devices than IEEE 802.11ah access points to guarantee 95% coverage. IEEE 802.11ah benefits from the use of lower frequency band, higher transmit power and better receiver sensitivity than BLE, which permits a low cost and effective deployment of Internet of Things applications. Mesh capabilities and range extension for BLE are therefore essential for the success of BLE within the Internet of Things framework.

In addition to that, continuous learning is required in many working areas to be able to deal with constant technological improvements. This is especially important for companies in the high-tech sector, in which employees are dealing with state of the art technologies. As an example, employees in industrial production facilities (like in the car industry) need to improve their skills whenever new components are added to the manufacturing process. Therefore, they can hugely benefit from learning on the job. Learning on the job while working in a production facility allows employees to extend their knowledge at the same time and at their current location when they require it. This usually takes place in a situational context, i.e. the context of the learner is related to the learning content. An example for situated learning on the job in manufacturing is an industrial mechanic who looks up instructions for the next production step. In contrast to off-the-job training the learning content is adjusted to the learner's current context. Augmented reality learning is one solution which can be used to enable situated learning on the job. This can be achieved by the use of wearable computers (wearables). As wearables are worn by the user and as such portable, always operational and allow a hands-free use, they can be used by employees in many situations when learning content is required. Furthermore, wearables can analyze the environment and its' surrounding context using build-in sensors (like GPS and Bluetooth for localization or image sensors for pattern matching) to provide situational learning content. This could even be done proactively, i.e. the wearable notifies the employee about relevant learning materials on its own. The main goal of this paper is to determine how learning in manufacturing companies can be supported using augmented reality learning on wearables. Therefore, we will first focus on identifying application scenarios in industrial production facilities which can benefit from using augmented reality learning to enhance the employees' skills on the job. Besides the identification of scenarios, we present a prototype for smart glasses which is targeted at employees in industrial production facilities for supporting learning on the job. It can be used for displaying learning content which is linked to real objects or locations using Bluetooth low energy. The prototype is developed for running natively on Google Glass. The results of this paper-the identified applications scenarios and the developed prototype-can be used as a basis for further research and for developing and deploying augmented reality learning applications in companies.

However the modifications were done only in the lower layers, leaving the Attribute Protocol (ATT), and the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) layers untouched, which is a significant drawback in the development of multihop network applications. In this paper the concept of Service Mediation is introduced, that is based on Named Data Networking (NDN) approach, and not only holds the solution of this problem within, but also shows great potential to create intelligent, automatic and teachable networks and applications. The experimental development and the preliminary validation tests showed satisfactory results also, which enables the approach to be used in real-world environments.

To do so, different technologies can be used, such as Near Field Communication, Quick Response Codes and Bluetooth Low Energy. This paper explores the possibility of implementing a mobile ticketing solution, with focus on the ticket validation process, using these technologies. They are analyzed and compared at different levels and two possible approaches proposed. Both solutions are presented in terms of infrastructure and maintenance cost, as well as passenger interaction and benefit. The feasibility and performance of the technologies is analyzed and presented in the context of the proposed approaches. As a result, a mobile ticketing solution can be implemented using different technologies, and their choice depends on factors such as the available funds, the intended interaction level, performance and the size of the target audience.

They need to be attentive and aware of the provided interaction mechanisms in order to initiate a desired process. Yet, interaction may also have an implicit nature when people do not perceive that they are controlling a system but continue their natural behavior. Exemplarily, Be-In/Be-Out (BIBO) ticketing services in public transportation systems utilize implicit interaction and enable passengers to obtain their (virtual) tickets just by "being" inside a vehicle. Infrastructural appliances detect their presence and initiate services unnoticed in the background. In this paper we focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as enabling technology for the implementation of BIBO systems, evidence its applicability for the domain of public transportation systems and confine our concepts to related Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) implementations.

There are various CICO technology widely available, ranging from paper and pen based simplest way to the Web and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) based systems. However, they are still far from providing an efficient and effective measurement to CICO status of massive users. In this study, we developed a novel CICO system based on the emerging technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity. According to the experimental evaluation, the new CICO system is more advanced than other related ones, in terms of its high availability of terminal medium, easy-going identification, the temporal and spatial precision in real-time proximity tracking, and also hassle-free user experience.

The economic toll due to higher-temperature, heat stress is a $1 billion annual problemi. Not only in the United States, but also around the globe heat stress causes an adverse impact on dairy productivity. The opportunities, however, for the dairy industry is to electronically monitor cattle temperature and implement appropriate measures so that the impact of HS can be minimized. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates nearly $2.4 billion a year in losses from animal illnesses that lead to death can be prevented by electronically checking on cattle's' vital signs(ii). This research paper recommends the most innovative electronic monitor framework, the 'Smart Connected Objects", aka, 'the Internet of Things (IoT)', that enables dairies to minimize the economic impact of HS and, at the same, capture the higher Return on Assets (ROA) & Return on Investment (ROI) by improving operational efficiencies. Happy Cow, more importantly, means happier, more profitable, dairy industry and richer and creamer dairy products. The proposed framework supports both offline and online dairy IoT. This paper presents a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.

Simplest way to communicate with these protocols over the internet is to use a Gateway. This paper proposes a design of gateway to communicate with both protocols using a single gateway. This design reduces the cost of using separate gateways for individual protocol. The BLE radio module is embedded on the gateway for all Bluetooth enabled sensors. Two radio modules of ZigBee are embedded at the gateway, one for data collected at intervals and another for streaming data. Scheduling is done with the help of a Linux kernel. This design furnishes advantages of both the protocols and also increases the data transmission rate of ZigBee with reduced latency. SSL and DTLS connections are used for added security.

These insoles provide a new set of non-invasive tools that can be used either at the clinical installations or at home. That solution improves the usability and user experience compared with traditional tools (smart carpets, wired insoles, etc.) that are oriented to clinical installations. And hence, provide a powerful tool for Ambient Intelligent for Health, especially for elderly people, increasing their autonomy and providing means for long term monitoring. Health parameters analysed are fall risk and gait analysis. Both are assessed on the establishment of clinical parameters such as fall risk index, and gait pattern and fall detection and algorithms. All those can be obtained thanks to our fully-wireless flexible insole that contains the sensors, embedded processing and wireless communications and charging. Pressure and inertial sensors are embedded into the insoles and a smartphone collects data utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy that is later sent to a main server analysis for its management, analysis and storage. This provides the selected information to the corresponding platform users being either end-users/patients, their relatives or caregivers and the related clinicians.

An all-digital PLL employs a digitally controlled oscillator with switching current sources to reduce supply voltage and power without sacrificing its phase noise and startup margins. It also reduces 1/f noise allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F-2 to maximally enhance its efficiency. The transmitter is realized in 28nm CMOS and satisfies all metal density and other manufacturing rules. It consumes 3.6 mW/5.5mW while delivering 0 dBm/3dBm RF power in Bluetooth Low-Energy.

Taking advantage of the emerging concept of connected car, the popularity of smartphones and the rise of Internet of Things, this work proposes a solution to predict where the best available parking spots are. The proposal includes both a centralized system to predict empty indoor parking spaces based on cellular automata, and a low-cost mobile application based on different technologies to help the driver to find empty parking spaces. On the one hand, cellular automata are used to model the behavior of drivers in parking facilities. Specifically, the system applies the idea behind the game of life to capture some features of parking occupancy based on common user behaviors, in order to reduce the time to find empty parking spots. On the other hand, the proposal involves a smartphone application that uses accurate technologies for indoor positioning. The client software is a lightweight Android application that provides different indoor positioning solutions, such as precise positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, or semi-precise positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The proposed service takes into account that it will be gradually adopted by users. The results obtained from a preliminary implementation show how the proposal improves the parking experience and increases efficiency of parking facilities in terms of time and energy costs.

With help of this information, it is possible to realize important real world tasks, for instance, context aware service, automation of common tasks and so on. Recently, there have been many studies on the indoor proximity detection with BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) and various techniques such as filtering and curve fitting have been suggested for the improvement of accuracy. However, those techniques are not adequate for the accurate indoor proximity detection, which limit the usable space and increase the error detection rate. In this study, we proposed the accurate indoor proximity zone detection technique based on time window, frequency of RSSI(Received Signal Strength Indicator) and user's walking. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This system consists of a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) part based on the encapsulated Application Programming Interface (API) of Apple's iOS platform and a low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fingerprinting calibration part. Pedestrian position information can be deduced from the PDR algorithm by applying distance and heading estimation and can be calibrated by a fingerprinting positioning matching algorithm. This hybrid positioning system improves the performance of the conventional PDR position algorithm which suffers from accumulated errors over time. Finally, the results obtained from evaluation test indicate that the proposed positioning system applying hybrid techniques is practical in indoor environment.

Its understanding may vary from geolocation that uses GPS infrastructure to locate objects on Earth, up to microlocation, which aims at locating users and objects inside closed areas. Although geolocation can be considered as a mature field, there is an ongoing research in the area of microlocation. Despite that, microlocation techniques do not offer satisfactory level of accuracy and implementation flexibility to be practically incorporated into commercial solutions. This is mainly because of high workload that needs to be done in terms of maps preparation and algorithms tuning. In this paper we present a method that can overcome this issue by providing incremental rule learning algorithm for automated discovery of user location on a room-level accuracy. We also show a method of augmenting semantic annotations on physical objects with a use of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons.

The multipath and non-line-of-sight errors from low-power wireless localization systems commonly result in outliers, affecting the positioning accuracy. We address this problem by adaptively weighting the estimates from the IMU and BLE in our proposed cascaded Kalman filter (KF). The positioning accuracy is further improved with the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against that of the standard KF experimentally. The results show that the proposed algorithm can maintain high accuracy for position tracking the sensor in the presence of the outliers.

In this monitoring system, a BLE signal scanner scans signal strength of BLE tags carried by people, to thus infer human movement patterns within its monitoring zone. However to the extent of our knowledge one main aspect of this monitoring system which has not yet been thoroughly investigated in literature is how to build a sound theoretical model, based on tunable BLE communication parameters such as scanning time interval and advertising time interval, to enable the study and design of effective and efficient movement monitoring systems. In this paper, we proposed and developed a statistical model based on Monte-Carlo simulation, which can be utilized to assess impacts of BLE technology parameters in terms of latency and efficiency, on a movement monitoring system, and can thus benefit a more efficient system design.

S	Lee, BG; Lee, BL; Chung, WY			IEEE	Lee, Boon-Giin; Lee, Boon-Leng; Chung, Wan-Young			Smartwatch-based Driver Alertness Monitoring with Wearable Motion and Physiological Sensor	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY					Studies have shown that a high precision driver alertness monitoring system is an essential and a monetary countermeasure to reduce the road accidents. This paper presents a novel approach to measure the driver alertness, evaluated by a smartwatch device based on fusion of direct and indirect method. The driver chronic physiological state is monitor by adopting a photoplethysmography sensor on the driver finger that is connected to a wrist-type wearable device. A Bluetooth Low Energy module connected to the wearable device transmits the PPG data to the smartwatch in real-time. Meanwhile, the indirect method, driver steering wheel movement can be derived by utilizing the motion sensors integrated in the smartwatch which include a tri-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope sensors. The respiration signals can be derived from the PPG time-and frequency-domains attributes. The data obtained from both methods aforementioned are subsequently decomposed into relevant features in time, spectral context and phase space domain, and thus computes the alertness index. Here, the correlations between the extracted features and the subjective Koralinska Sleepiness Scale are studied as well along with the recorded experimental videos. This study reveals that the alertness index prediction accuracy can be reached up to 96.3% based on the descriptive extracted features.

For high quality audio service especially on wireless network, the audio codec with low latency is indispensible since the latency prevents a user from being immersed in the service. This paper presents a low latency audio coder design with a short length window. Side effects due to the short length window are mitigated by the proposed coding tools such as pitch coding and low frequency masking threshold control. The audio quality assessed by the objective and subjective manners shows that the proposed design outperforms the well-known commercial codec.

The demodulator is based on a phase-shift quadrature discriminator. A preamble detector controls the sequencing of the blocks operation to minimize power consumption. An IF input signal of 1 MHz is used, the same of the data rate, hence, allowing a low-power receiver implementation. The implementation is fully digital with a silicon area of 0.06 mm(2) in 130 nm process. Simulations show a state-of-art current consumption of about 143 mu A from a single 1.2 V supply voltage. The proposed demodulator requires a SNR of 15 dB for a BER of 0.1 % for up to +/- 200 kHz frequency offset variation.

As a power-management capability, whenever there is less data to send, the slave is allowed to remain in a low power mode during a given number of time-slots in a row. However, since the master does not know the exact sleep behavior of the slave, it has to wake-up at every time-slot and repeat its packets until the slave is awake. As a result, applications with variable throughput lead to many energy-consuming idle-slots at the master. In such applications, usually the connection parameters are chosen considering the worst case at design time and remain constant during operation. In this paper, we propose a novel power-management framework for BLE. Rather than skipping slots at the slave side, the proposed system updates the interval between two consecutive time-slots during runtime by applying online algorithms. To avoid data-loss or high delays, the framework guarantees that constraints on latency are met and buffers never overflow. Energy measurements of three different test-cases show that up to 42 percent of the energy consumption of a BLE master can be saved with our power management system.

Sensors deployed on the human body, especially at the limbs often move along different positions. Usually, the transmit power is set to a sufficiently high value to achieve reliable transmission for the constellation with highest attenuation. For periodic movements, data transmission can be carried out at the position of the lowest path loss between the sender and the receiver, provided this position can be reliably identified. We propose a novel framework that predicts this position using acceleration data and the received signal strength. By learning a correlation between these signals, accurate predictions can be performed and up to 24.7% of the power spent by a Bluetooth Low Energy module for the transmission of a packet can be saved while still achieving the same packet error rate as with sending using the higher transmit power.

Several existing works already exploited to provide an acoustic streaming service over IP, LTE, Bluetooth and even Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Due to the different communication mechanism from IP, in case of Bluetooth and BLE, it is impossible to provide direct communication. To offer the advantage of IP communication over BLE device, 6lo WG over BLE is in progress. Based on 6lo BLE, we introduce our prototype of acoustic data streaming service over IP enabled BLE. We evaluate our service with various metrics such as packet loss, latency and throughput. The results show the various performance of BLE-IP device.

The device is primarily aimed at continuously tracking the skin temperature to indicate the onset of hypothermia in newborns. A medical grade thermistor is responsible for temperature measurement and is directly interfaced to a microcontroller with an integrated bluetooth low energy radio. An inertial sensor is also present in the device to facilitate breathing rate measurement which has been discussed briefly. Sensed data is transferred securely over bluetooth low energy radio to a nearby gateway, which relays the information to a central database for real time monitoring. Low power optimizations at both the circuit and software levels ensure a prolonged battery life. The device is packaged in a baby friendly, water proof housing and is easily sterilizable and reusable.	[Rao, Hiteshwar; Saxena, Dhruv; Sagar, G.

The penetration of tracking devices with sensory such as GPS devices, accelerators and specifically smart phones has impacted human lives extensively. Nowadays, many applications on smart phones and mobile devices exploit different techniques and inputs for positioning. Wireless positioning is generally divided into two categories: outdoor positioning and indoor positioning, depending on not only where they are used but also how they work. Powerful as it is, indoor positing is still a challenging problem because satellite-based approaches do not work properly inside buildings. Therefore, for indoor positioning, we need to use other technologies creatively. iBeacon, the focus of this paper, is a new technology which provides a higher level of location awareness in indoor positioning. iBeacon is a built-in, cross-platform technology for Android and iOS devices, which utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for long-last services. This technology has significant advantages compared to other types of indoor positioning technologies, such as less expensive hardware, less energy consumption, needless to internet connection, and being capable of receiving notifications in background. This technology will provide huge benefits for future location awareness applications. It will change the way retailers, event organizers, and educational institutions communicate with people indoors. In this paper, we aim to provide a more accurate, cost efficient approach to indoor positioning of mobile devices using iBeacon.

There are different conventional methods for capturing respiration signal, such as polysomnography and spirometer. In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high correlation between spirometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on respiration signals. The obtained results show that DFA can be used as an efficient feature while classifying the healthy people from patients suffering from breath abnormalities.

To determine the reliability of this technology several tests were performed to check if measured distance between Bluetooth transmitter and mobile device is close to the real value. Distance measurement focused on Bluetooth technology based mainly on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which is used to calculate the distance between a transmitter and a receiver. As the research results show, the Bluetooth LE signal power cannot be the only reliable source of information for precise indoor localization.

Users point their devices towards each other to link them into a group (point to link). The relative positions are estimated between the grouped devices (link to group) with Bluetooth low energy received signal strength indication and the digital compass readings. The relative positions are then used for identifying the recipients for data transfer by swiping towards the physical direction (swipe to send). In this paper, we studied the possible operations to enable: point to link, link to group and swipe to send and compared Shuriken to existing techniques for user grouping and data transfer. We envision practical uses of Shuriken in collaborative shopping in a cafe, data transfer in business meetings and localisation of smart devices.

Among many platforms that need to be localized and tracked are pedestrians. A reliable indoor pedestrians tracking has a wide range of applications such as healthcare, retail, rescue missions and context-awareness applications. This paper introduces a calibration-free hybrid indoor positioning system that utilizes inertial sensors (INS), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and low-cost Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) wireless beacons. BLE beacons are becoming very popular in retails and they can be easily installed in any indoor environment. To deal with jumpy and noisy nature of wireless positioning indoors, and to cancel out the unbounded drifts associated with INS, this work investigates the utilization of Grid-based nonlinear Bayesian filtering to fuse all the aforementioned sensors measurements. The motion-updated prior is modeled as a probability distribution (PD) that takes discrete values (cells) with a pre-defined resolution. This prior PD is shaped by the pedestrian dead-reckoning model (PDR). The measurements-updated posterior PD is calculated using a numerical approximation of Bayes' rule where measurements are signal strength observations. The measurement model is mainly a tightly-coupled model where all motion states, sensors errors, and wireless propagation models are represented. To further enhance the accuracy, all RSS measurements are filtered out by a separate Kalman filter with a Gauss-Markov process model. The performance is further enhanced by applying measurements updates from BLE beacons. The system is realized on an experimental setup that consists of off-the-shelf INS existing on smart-phone and WiFi. For flexibility and analysis purposes, the BLE beacons were simulated on top of the collected INS/WiFi measurements. The ground-truth was obtained by an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped by INS and Odometer aided by floor maps.

It can be considered on many different levels of granularity, varying from geolocation that is based on GPS systems, up to microlocation that uses Bluetooth Low Energy devices and WiFi access points for locating users inside buildings. Most common use of location is navigation, however recently it is more often considered also as an important component of the user profile. One of the biggest challenges in location-based context-aware systems is the discovery of patterns in user transportation traces and extraction of the most often visited places. In this paper we presented and evaluated a method that allows for automatic extraction of clusters from user location traces. These clusters represents user points of interest like home, work, favourite restaurants, but also transportation routines. The original contribution of this work is a proposal of an approach based on the K-means clustering algorithm equipped with a module for automatic discovery of number of clusters and density-based cluster merging. This method allows for online, adaptable discovery of user points of interests, and transportation routines in mobile systems.

BLE is a new brand technology focused on information transmission using very low energy consumption. It is being included in mobile devices from year 2011, nowadays almost every new mobile phone is shipped with this technology. Robot localization using particles filter has been developed in recent years using wireless technologies with a significant success. BLE beacons measures are rather noisier than measures from similar wireless devices. In this work we make an initial model of BLE measures and their noise. The model is used to generate data to be processed by a particle filter designed for localization using only ultrawide band (UWB) beacons ranges. Data are generated with different noise level in order to explore localization errors behavior, these levels cover real noise levels founded in RSSI measure characterization.	[Cuadra-Troncoso, J.

BLE is a well-known technology for the low-power connectivity suitable for IoT devices and also for the proximity with the range of several meters. Apple has already adopted the technic and enhanced it to provide subdivided proximity range levels. But as it is also a variation of RSS-based distance estimation, iBeacon could only provide immediate, near or far status but not a real and accurate distance. To provide the distance using BLE, this paper introduces additional self-correcting beacon to calibrate the reference distance and mitigate errors from environmental factors. By adopting self-correcting beacon while measuring the distance, the average distance error showed less than 10% within the range of 1.5 meters. Some considerations are presented to extend the range to be able to get accurate distances. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Researchers tried to adapt various short-range technologies for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) in ubiquitous health monitoring. The classical Bluetooth is known for its greedy power consumption, IrDA and NFC require line-of-sight conditions, and ANT has weak coexistence features and interference issues. A typical choice remains ZigBee/6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 based solutions in WBANs because of their low-power consumption. However, the recently proposed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) announced more compelling features in various aspects. Only few studies have been published supporting these claims on BLE. In this paper, we present a BLE based remote healthcare monitoring platform and we study its compatibility for ECG monitoring. ECG data requires continuous and real-time transmissions, making it particularly challenging for resource constrained devices. In our system, a BLE112 module from Bluegiga and a BLE USB dongle are used for WBAN. The performance of the system is evaluated experimentally and the results showed good potential of this proposed BLE platform in meeting the main QoS requirements of medical applications in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and packet error rate, while staying energy efficient.

J	Andersson, S; Yan, L				Andersson, Sebastian; Yan, Liu			Orientation Capture of a Walker's Leg Using Inexpensive Inertial Sensors with Optimized Complementary Filter Design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Motion capture; Complementary Filter; Inertial sensors; Bluetooth Low Energy; iOS		Accelerometers and gyroscope are often referred to as inertial sensors. They detect movement and are used for motion tracking systems in many fields. In recent years they have become much smaller, lighter and cheaper which makes them attractive for use in consumer electronics. The goal of this research is to use all these advantages to create a cheap, low cost and accurate motion tracking system. The system that will be developed is using two pairs of accelerometer + gyroscope sensors which communicates with an iOS device using BLE. The sensors are attached to a persons leg to capture the orientation of the leg while walking or running. Studying the movements of a persons leg can be useful regarding both performance and health aspects. To create the system, usage of inertial sensors and how to combine their data using the complementary filter have been studied. Further, several experiments were made to optimize the filter design for this kind of movement. The results shows how the orientation estimation differs in accuracy depending on different values of how the filter is designed. However, by using the right values, a fairly accurate orientation of the leg can be estimated which is proved by the simple visualization of the iOS application.

In order to perform the simultaneous measurements at several distances, two light sources with different wavelengths are located at one end of a line followed by seven photo diodes. Bluetooth Low Energy are adopted as their primary communication protocol as a wireless communication. The measured data from the MD-NIR interactance sensors are wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone or a tablet for analysis. The feasibility of the approach and wireless platform is demonstrated using the ex vivo pig fat layer phantoms.

On the Potential of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Vehicular Applications	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article							WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	With the increasing number of sensors in modern vehicles, using an intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN) is a possible solution for the automotive industry for addressing the potential issues that arise from additional wiring harness. Such a solution could help car manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which wireless technology should be used for maximizing the benefits of IVWSNs is still an open issue. In this article we propose to use a new wireless technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and outline a new architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study that encompasses an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good performance and low-power, low-complexity, and low-cost attributes.

One of the main challenges of wireless networks, especially mesh networks, is optimizing these networks such that they provide strong and reliable communication channels with minimum resource consumption. In this paper, we design and build a wireless network planning tool which achieves successful node-to-node communication through proper node placement. This tool aids ZigBee network designers in optimizing their wireless networks. Zein tool is made to simulate the zigbee mesh network in any structure and determine the exact locations of additional nodes to be placed to insure proper operation of the mesh network.

Application examples include location-based information and advertisements, logistics, social networking, file sharing, etc. In this paper, we consider positioning of devices based on time series proximity reports from a mobile device to a network node. This corresponds to nonlinear measurements with respect to the device position in relation to the network nodes. Therefore, particle filtering is applicable for positioning. Positioning performance is evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-low-energy beacons deployed for proximity detection and report. Accuracy is concluded to vary spatially over the office floor, and in relation to the beacon deployment density.

The desired RSS threshold is found through optimizing a metric function (for instance the localization root-mean-square-error) in terms of both the deployment information and the RSS modeling in consideration of an evaluation area. The resulting RSS threshold provides a trade-off between triggering many but less informative proximity reports with a low threshold, and triggering few but very informative proximity reports with a high threshold, and thus enables enhanced performance for some low-cost and low-complex proximity based positioning algorithms. The proposed framework is also validated with real RSS measurements collected in an office area with deployed bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons.

Knowing a building's occupancy plays a crucial role in implementing demand-response HVAC. In this paper we propose a new solution based on the iBeacon technology. This solution is different from the previous ones because it leverages on the Bluetooth Low Energy standard, which provides lower power consumption. Moreover, the iBeacon protocol can be used both on iOs systems and Android ones, making this new approach portable. Differently from our previous work based on iOS devices, in this paper we focus on an Android based solution with the aim of increasing the accuracy of the location and the energy efficiency of the entire system. We increased the accuracy by 10% and the energy efficiency by 15%.	[Corna, A.; Fontana, L.; Nacci, A.

The user may express restrictions, such as who can access the resources, at which point in time and from which location. However, the location requirement is difficult to achieve in an indoor environment. Determining user locations inside of buildings is based on a variety of solutions. Moreover, current access control solutions do not consider restricting access to sensitive data in indoor environments. This article presents a graphical web interface based on OpenStreetMap (OSM), called Indoor Mapping Web Interface (IMWI), which is designed to use indoor maps and floor plans of several real-world objects, such as hospitals, universities and other premises. By placing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons inside buildings and by labeling them on digital indoor maps, the web interface back-end will provide the stored location data within an access control environment. Using the stored information will enable users to express indoor access control restrictions. Moreover, the IMWI enables and ensures the accurate determination of a user device location in indoor scenarios. By defining several scenarios the usability of the IMWI and the validity of the policies have been evaluated.	[Sharhan, Senan M.

An enhanced version of a tongue-operated robotic rehabilitation system is presented for accelerating the rate of improvement in the upper extremity motor functions for patients with severe hemiparesis following stroke. A new rehabilitation robot, called Hand Mentor ProTM (HM), was utilized by reading its pressure and joint angle sensors, combined with control commands from the Tongue Drive System (TDS) to enable both isometric and isotonic target-tracking tasks in a coordinated tongue-hand rehabilitation paradigm. Preliminary results in 3 healthy subjects who performed a sinusoidal target tracking task demonstrated the TDS-HM system functionality in hand-operated isometric, hand-operated isotonic, tongue-operated isotonic discrete control and tongue-operated isotonic proportional control modes with average normalized root-mean-square errors of 0.058 +/- 0.023, 0.043 +/- 0.011, 0.184 +/- 0.087, and 0.148 +/- 0.075, respectively.

The device transmits fatigue and surface electromyographic (sEMG) data to an Android application in real-time via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection. The device contains an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that tracks muscle fatigue by estimating the Muscle Fibre Conduction Velocity (MFCV).

The ASIC estimates the Muscle Fibre Conduction Velocity (MFCV) of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals, which provides a metric for quantifying the muscle fatigue state. Analysing the rate of muscle fatigue can be used in muscle rehabilitation, ergonomics and sports science. The system inside the wearable contains a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) System on Chip that calibrates the ASIC and relays the fatigue information to an Android application. The wearable and Android application together form the Muscle Fatigue Monitor. This miniature system offers the same level of muscle fatigue monitoring compared to traditional bulky EMG monitoring systems, whilst extending users' degree of freedom, range and comfort. The wearable consumes 11.21mA of current while BLE is active and 4.71mA of current when inactive. Powered by a 3.7V Lithium-Polymer battery with a capacity of 300mAh, the wearable has a battery life of up to 64 hours.

The proposed system is encompassed with four rectangular slanted overlapping high-Q resonators and a wirewound driver coil, all tuned at 13.56 MHz. An optical headstage is implemented capable of driving 4 micro light-emitting diodes (mu-LEDs) based on stimulation commands received via the BLE link on-the-fly, while being wirelessly powered in a closed-loop fashion.

Although mostly uncomplicated and easily treatable, if identified early, UTI can be a major source of morbidity and mortality in geriatric patients, in particular, those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and in infants who have difficulties in communicating symptoms, making early identification of UTIs crucial. In this paper, we present a diaper-embedded, wireless, self-powered, and autonomous UTI monitoring sensor module that allows an effortless early detection of UTIs. The sensor module consists of a paper-based colorimetric nitrite sensor, urine-powered batteries, a boost converter, a low-power sensor interface utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM), and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module for wireless transmission. Experimental results show a better detection of nitrite, a surrogate of UTI, than conventional dipstick testing. The sensor module achieves a sensitivity of 1.35 ms/(mg/L)and a detection limit of 4 mg/ L for nitrite.

Strong authentication security demands, among other requirements, long, frequently hard-to-remember passwords. Two-factor authentication aids in the security, even though, as a side effect, might worsen user experience. We depict a mobile sign-on scheme that benefits from the dynamic relationship between a user's attributes, the service the user wishes to utilize, and location (where the user is, and what services are available there) as an authentication factor. We demonstrate our scheme employing Bluetooth Low Energy beacons for location awareness and the expressiveness of Attribute-Based Encryption to capture and leverage the described relationship. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons broadcast encrypted messages with encoded access policies. Within range of the beacons, a user with appropriate attributes is able to decrypt the broadcast message and obtain parameters that allow the user to perform a short or simplified login.

The method relies on a key observation that each capacitive touch screen has a unique capacitive signature, which is caused by either the difference in touch sensing technologies or the imperfections of the sensor during its fabrication. In particular, the voltage pattern generated by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) capacitive touchscreens during finger touch sensing is uniquely identifiable. Our preliminary evaluation with actual hardware prototype on 14 mobile touchscreens shows that on-top achieves a promising performance of 100% detection rate without any false positive. We also show that on-top can be used to securely trigger wireless communication while it consumes a very little amount of power (38.18 times lower than triggering using Near Field Communication (NEC) and 18.28 times lower than using Bluetooth low energy (BLE)).

The technology aims to provide an energy-efficient low-cost wireless communication mechanism for a wide range of resource-limited consumer electronic devices and applications. In this paper we focus on the networking aspects of the technology. First, we overview fundamentals of BLE communication technology, discuss its capabilities and limitations, and compare BLE with state-of-the-art technologies. Furthermore, we identify and discuss two scenarios, for which standard BLE communication mechanisms show poor performance and propose two mechanisms capable of improving throughput and energy efficiency of BLE communication in multi node environment. The efficiency of the proposed mechanisms is proved via network level simulations, which are executed using the developed BLE simulation tool. The results of the simulations are reported and discussed. We believe that the presented results might be of some interest not only for academic researchers but also for practicing engineers.

Therefore, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, low cost Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors, barometers and magnetometers have been the standard configuration for many current smartphones, smart watches and tablets to provide positioning information. Although Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) based portable navigation system with GNSS and multiple sensors is able to provide promising positioning results in most outdoor environments, in the absence of GNSS signals in indoor or deep urban environments, it still lacks robustness because of the accumulated heading error and step length error, in addition to the challenges of portability and free change of the orientation and usage of the device by the user. These shortcomings will cause a skewed path over time and produce position estimates that might not be consistent with the building layout. The resulting paths cross walls, floors or other obstacles. Although magnetometer measurements can be used to update the heading, they are vulnerable to interferences which are quite common in complex indoor environments. This paper proposes a robust indoor navigation solution integrating low-cost sensors in consumer devices with indoor map matching and wireless positioning. The user can operate the portable device freely without constraints, such as talking on the phone, dangling the phone beside them, texting, putting the phone in their pocket, on their belt or in their backpack. The motion context detection algorithm can detect the user's motion patterns such as walking, fidgeting, going up/down stairs, standing/walking on escalators, or using elevators. The proposed map matching engine is based on multihypothesis Kalman filter and is very computationally efficient. The map match engine can manage the hypothesis creation, trim and removal based on the user position uncertain and the motion context. These motion contexts can be used to apply 2D position update to improve positioning performance and also to initiate floor changes. Furthermore, any incorrect misalignment between portable devices and the human body can be monitored and corrected based on the current indoor environments. Moreover, the map match engine analyzes the history of the user's trajectory and indoor environments to improve the step length estimates from PDR. Finally, the indoor map is combined with WiFi positioning to derive a more reliable weighting scheme based on the indoor environments. Also, with the map information, WiFi blunders can be more reliably removed. The proposed system can also use heading and speed estimated from the wireless system, if they are available; it is also capable of taking other wireless updates if they are available, such as for example from Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Real-time test results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed portable positioning system.

In this paper, we propose a low-cost object localization system that uses static devices with Bluetooth capabilities, which are distributed in an environment, to detect and localize active Bluetooth beacons and mobile devices. This system can be used by a robot to coarsely localize objects in retrieval tasks. We attach small Bluetooth low energy tags to objects and require at least four static Bluetooth receivers. While commodity Bluetooth devices could be used, we have built low-cost receivers from Raspberry Pi computers. The location of a tag is estimated by lateration of its received signal strengths. In experiments, we evaluate accuracy and timing of our approach, and report on the successful demonstration at the RoboCup German Open 2014 competition in Magdeburg.

The performance evaluation of classical Bluetooth device discovery have been intensively studied using analytical modeling and simulative methods, but these techniques are not applicable to BLE, since BLE has a fundamental change in the design of the discovery mechanism, including the usage of three advertising channels. Recently, there several works have analyzed the topic of BLE device discovery, but these studies are still far from thorough. It is thus necessary to develop a new, accurate model for the BLE discovery process. In particular, the wide range settings of the parameters introduce lots of potential for BLE devices to customize their discovery performance. This motivates our study of modeling the BLE discovery process and performing intensive simulation. This paper is focused on building an analytical model to investigate the discovery probability, as well as the expected discovery latency, which are then validated via extensive experiments. Our analysis considers both continuous and discontinuous scanning modes. We analyze the sensitivity of these performance metrics to parameter settings to quantitatively examine to what extent parameters influence the performance metric of the discovery processes.

A single-channel phase-tracking RX based on a sliding-IF phase-to-digital conversion (SIF-PDC) loop is proposed to directly demodulate and digitize the frequency/phase-modulated information. The sliding-IF frequency plan reduces the power consumption of the multi-phase LO generation. A phase rotator is adopted in SIF-PDC to guarantee frequency stability, i.e., avoid the frequency pulling by interference or frequency drift. It equivalently transforms the RF signal processing from the I/Q amplitude domain to a digital-phase domain, which saves up to nearly 40% on power consumption and relaxes the digital baseband complexity. A phase-domain linear model of the proposed SIF-PDC is presented to analyze the frequency response. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS technology, the presented RX consumes 2.4 mW at 2Mbps data rate, i.e., 1.2 nJ/b efficiency, and achieves a sensitivity of -92 dBm.

Bluetooth LE is a rapidly emerging ultra-low-power radio technology expected to be incorporated in billions of IoT devices in the next few years. Consequently, it is particularly important to specify Internet connectivity solutions for Bluetooth LE. In this article we present such solutions based on the ongoing standardization work in the IETF and Bluetooth Special Interest Group. We prove the feasibility of a complete IP-based protocol stack on constrained devices and illustrate its performance, highlighting key trade-offs. In addition, we discuss gateway operation covering global IPv6 connectivity and proxy-cache functionality.

This is achieved through the use of efficient mixers with improved out-of-band suppression, including rejection of the second harmonic, and an local-oscillator generator achieving current reuse and rejection of voltage-controlled oscillator signal imbalance through the use of complementary devices. Manufactured in 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor and with a power consumption below 550 mu W from a 0.85 V supply, the front-end achieves a conversion gain of 41 dB and a noise figure of 9.6 dB. It has an out-of-band IIP3 and IIP2 of -3 dBm and 29.5 dBm, respectively. The quadrature phase error is below 0.6 degrees. Requiring only two inductors it occupies an area of just 0.15 mm(2) excluding pads.

J	Fekr, AR; Janidarmian, M; Radecka, K; Zilic, Z				Fekr, Atena Roshan; Janidarmian, Majid; Radecka, Katarzyna; Zilic, Zeljko			A Medical Cloud-Based Platform for Respiration Rate Measurement and Hierarchical Classification of Breath Disorders	SENSORS			English	Article						respiration rate; breath analysis; accelerometer sensor; Support Vector Machine; breath disorder	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SLEEP-APNEA; ACCELEROMETER; COMPLEXITY; MONITOR; SENSOR	The measurement of human respiratory signals is crucial in cyberbiological systems. A disordered breathing pattern can be the first symptom of different physiological, mechanical, or psychological dysfunctions. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of the respiration patterns, as well as respiration rate is a critical need in medical applications. There are several methods for respiration rate measurement. However, despite their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based platform for both monitoring the respiration rate and breath pattern classification, remotely. The proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e. g., respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud-computing model. We also suggest a procedure to improve the accuracy of respiration rate for patients at rest positions. The overall error in the respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.53% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. Five types of respiration disorders, Bradapnea, Tachypnea, Cheyn-stokes, Kaussmal, and Biot's breathing are classified based on hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) with seven different features. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed classification while it is individualized to every subject (case 1) as well as considering all subjects (case 2). Since the selection of kernel function is a key factor to decide SVM's performance, in this paper three different kernel functions are evaluated. The experiments are conducted with 11 subjects and the average accuracy of 94.52% for case 1 and the accuracy of 81.29% for case 2 are achieved based on Radial Basis Function (RBF). Finally, a performance evaluation has been done for normal and impaired subjects considering sensitivity, specificity and G-mean parameters of different kernel functions.

In order to realize high sample rate monitoring applications, it requires either transmitting raw data using a high-throughput radio transceiver or performing computation within the sensor node and then transmitting a small amount of information. In relation to a energy constrained wireless sensing node, a quantitative evaluation of raw data transmission using different short range wireless technologies and in-sensor processing is conducted in this paper. The results, associated with the energy consumption of two data intensive monitoring applications, suggest that in-sensor processing resulting in a small amount of data to be transmitted consumes less energy as compared to that of raw data transmission, even under ideal channel conditions.

The network node integrates sensors for ambient monitoring, e.g. the recording of temperature, 3D acceleration and ambient light measurement. Recorded data can be sent via BLE to any remote device which supports BLE, e.g. a smartphone. In this paper, a heart rate sensor is implemented to demonstrate heart rate signal processing and its applications in sports. The on-board signal processing is performed on the MSP430 low-power microcontroller. As an example application, the data is wirelessly sent to a smartphone running Android OS for visualization.

Bluetooth LE supports the star network topology; however the tree network topology is not supported. To implement a tree topology, three different nodes are designed: the central or the root node which collects all the data, the intermediate node formed by combining two Bluetooth devices in one package and the leaf node which is the lowest node of the network. Important WSN parameters such as ranges between nodes, power consumption and latency are evaluated. According to the test results, it can be concluded that the tree topology can be used with Bluetooth low energy for the purposes of range extension, extending the number of network nodes or even just data processing by the central node.

In this paper, a novel technique, which provides efficient operation by adapting BLE protocol in accordance with consumable power limitations, is proposed. The essence of this technique lies in the observation that a considerable decrease in power comsumption can be achieved by lengthening advertisement intervals. The scheduling algortihm, which was developed as a result of problem formulation and analysis, maximizes advertisement throughput and minimizes the expected total waste of receiving attempts produced by near wireless receivers while setting advertisement intervals according to energy harvesting rates.

In this work a strapdown INS (SINS) in terms of Inertial Navigation System is discussed. INS is an electronic device, containing an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), implementing a Dead Reckoning (DR) algorithm. This algorithm estimates position, velocity and orientation utilizing readings from motion sensors. The logic behind DR algorithm is to continually adding detected changes from the sensors to its previously calculated results. This is the main reason why INS is limited to measure relative position and orientation. Thus the accuracy of the propagated position depends heavily on the quality of the initial conditions. In addition, if absolute position or orientation updates are obtained by another sensor source at a high rate, the INS can be used to deliver high precision positions. In this paper, an INS fused with the new Bluetooth v4.0 technology is described.

Attackers have stolen bitcoins worth millions of dollars from victims by using malware to gain access to the private keys stored on the victims' computers or smart phones. In order to protect the Bitcoin private keys, we propose the use of a hardware token for the authorization of transactions. We created a proof-of-concept Bitcoin hardware token: BlueWallet. The device communicates using Bluetooth Low Energy and is able to securely sign Bitcoin transactions. The device can also be used as an electronic wallet in combination with a point of sale and serves as an alternative to cash and credit cards.

This paper describes the overall architecture of the node as well as the hardware and software modules design. A motion sensing system is designed for testing the performance of the motion sensor node. The system can capture 3-axis acceleration data and transmit data by low-power Bluetooth to a PC or a mobile client. The TI single-mode chip CC2540 is used as the communication core chip in this system. Moreover, TI MSP430F5340 and ST LIS3DH are used as the primary controller and the motion sensor. The system consists of a USB dongle communication node and three motion sensor nodes to achieve three motion sensor data while communicating with the USB dongle. The results show that the node is stable with a strong practical value. The system used in the field of physical exercise not only eliminates the physical limitations imposed by hardwired links, but also reduces the height of the system of long-term power consumption.

Use of Inertial Dead Reckoning and Activity Recognition to Enable Always-On, Low-Power Contextually Aware Applications in Mobile Devices	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2014)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	27th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 08-12, 2014	Tampa, FL	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Location technologies in smart mobile devices are being utilized not only in traditional foreground applications such as maps and navigation, but also now in a new array of background tracking applications. In foreground applications, location and navigation accuracy is key. The power consumption of the foreground application is less of a concern since the screen of the mobile device is on and dominating the battery usage. In background applications, the device screen and many other system resources are powered down, so priorities shift more toward conserving power of any remaining active applications. One important emerging background application is user context, commonly referred to as "contextual awareness". Contextually-aware mobile applications try to identify three key pieces of information: 1) Where am I? (location); 2) What am I doing? (activity); and 3) Who/What am I close to? (proximity) In order to extract the most value from this feature, app developers and service providers seek to leave the context application "always-on". Inertial sensing solutions play a key role in determining the location and activity parameters of context, not only improving accuracy and coverage, but they also help to reduce overall system power as part of a hybrid location solution with WiFi, GNSS, and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE). In contrast to traditional foreground location applications, user context tracking is on all the time and focuses more on coverage versus navigation. In many cases, coarse location (less accuracy) is acceptable in exchange for more efficient power consumption. This paper outlines the characteristics of a background context tracking implementation covering not only robust, low-power inertial dead reckoning, but also user activity classification.

Early experimentation demonstrated that the low bandwidth of BLE signals compared to WiFi is the cause of significant measurement error when coupled with the use of three BLE advertising channels. The physics underlying this behaviour is verified in simulation. A multipath mitigation scheme is proposed and tested. It is determined that the optimal positioning performance is provided by 10Hz beaconing and a 1 second multipath mitigation processing window size. It is determined that a steady increase in positioning performance with fingerprint size occurs up to 7 +/- 1, above this there is no clear benefit to extra beacon coverage.

The single-path receiver selects the intermediate frequency (IF) at a half of channel bandwidth specific for BLE frequency assignment. The proposed IF signal processing, unlike the conventional frequency discrimination, is implemented by quantizing analog signals with linear-in-phase thresholds. The mixed-signal IF processor successfully demodulates the received signals under 1-MHz data rate. It requires an SNR of 15.5 dB for a bit error rate of 0.1%. The circuits consume 1.1 mA from a single 1.8-V supply voltage with a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology.

The device uses single BLE System-on-Chip to process the algorithm of blood pressure measurement and data transmission. Through the newest Bluetooth Low Energy technology, device can send measured results to the smartphone. Therefore, users can get the information of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate on the smartphone. Besides, the format of data transmission packet is based on the standard Blood Pressure Profile specification from Bluetooth SIG. The homemade blood pressure monitor has high compatibility to communication with other devices using the same Bluetooth profile. The accuracy of pulse rate and blood pressures are verified through the CuffLink simulator. The accuracy of pulse rate is -1.13 +/- 0.52 beats, the accuracy of systolic blood pressure is 0.69 +/- 1.63 mmHg, and the accuracy of diastolic blood pressure is 0.20 +/- 1.02 mmHg. In clinical trials, the systolic blood pressure average difference between our method and auscultatory method is 2.66 +/- 2.71 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure average difference between our method and auscultatory method is 3.42 +/- 4.42 mmHg. As a result, this device has high accuracy for measuring blood pressure and pulse rate.

Several technologies have emerged over the last decade that allow cars to communicate with each other and with the Internet. In this paper we propose to use the new Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard as an alternative technology to exchange data between vehicles. By the means of experiments we show that smartphones with BLE radios can be used to send information at low latency from one car to another even while driving. A communication range of up to 100m can be achieved depending on the scenario and environment. Those promising first results are then used as basis for discussion to identify the potential of BLE for different types of vehicular applications.

This architecture, ideal for over-MHz bandwidth PLL, is composed of a low power ring oscillator (RO) used as voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), and a divider which reuses the RO phases to perform a quasi-perfect fractional division. We provide an implementation of this low area architecture, used as low power local oscillator (LO) for Internet of Things (IoT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Additionally we propose four VCOs architectures phase noise measurements designed on FDSOI 28nm with extreme power optimization, planned to be used for this architecture.

Therefore, a wearable exercise intensity monitoring device can assist user to manage their exercise intensity. Heart rate (HR) is an index to indicate the exercise intensity. In this paper, we proposed a high accuracy HR detection method and implemented it on a wearable and low power device for exercise intensity monitoring. This device consists of a two-electrode ECG amplifier, a MSP430 microprocessor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. Moreover, the device can transmit the HR to a Smartphone via the BLE. The accuracy of HR detection method is verified in both resting and dynamic conditions. For resting condition, we use a commercial ECG simulator as signal input and the accuracy of HR detection is 100 percents. For dynamic condition, we use treadmill test. Three subjects (2 male, 1 female) walking in six speeds from 1.8 km/h until 6.3 km/h and running in 7.2 km/h. The accuracy of HR detection is 99.7 percents.

Wearable devices and ambient devices are also getting popular and can easily access the Internet through smart devices. Although smart devices have incredibly advanced functionalities, their I/O is poor because of their small size. Peripherals are able to compensate for the shortcomings, but currently there is no unified methodology to gather and integrate given devices. We have developed a customizable Web-based system in which services in the Cloud can federate smart devices and peripherals. The proposed system uses Web-based technologies to coordinate between cloud services and the devices at hand. The main benefit is that Web application developers can create an entire system since the configuration and operation of all devices are describable only in Java Script. We have also separated the device functionality from the application logic, thus enabling parallel development. We implemented a prototype system using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and found that it could be easily used to develop a system that emulates a POS terminal.

Textile-based Capacitive Sensor for a Wireless Wearable Breath Monitoring System	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (ICCE)	IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	JAN 10-13, 2014	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE		abdominal breathing; Bluetooth low-energy; mobility; textile-based sensor		A capacitive sensor is demonstrated as the key component of a wearable breath monitoring system. Its capacitance varies proportional to the pressure acting on it with high linearity and wide working range. All of the components of the sensor, including conductors, insulator, and conductive wires, are textile materials and are thus as soft as ordinary clothes; therefore, the sensor is also washable and durable. By installing one sensor on the chest and another on the lower abdomen, thoracic and abdominal breathing can be detected independently with little crosstalk. Driven by a low-power NE556 oscillator, the capacitances of both sensors can be detected digitally and then transmitted by a Bluetooth low-energy wireless communication module to a smartphone. Thus, a wearable breath monitoring system is implemented to provide continuous and real time breath signal monitoring without mobility constraints.(1)	[Yang, C. M.; Yang, T. L.; Wu, C.

By the time a paraeducator ('para') is able to break away and record events, behavior counts can be forgotten. This paper presents a paraeducator glove design that can help to track behaviors with minimal distraction by allowing a paraeducator to touch their thumb to one of their other four fingers, where each finger represents a different behavior. Count data are packaged by a microcontroller board on the glove and then sent wirelessly to a smart phone via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) link. A customized BLE profile was designed for this application to promote real-time recording. These data can be forwarded to a database for further analysis. This para glove design addresses basic needs of a wearable device that employs BLE, including local data collection, BLE data transmission, and remote data recording. More functional sensors can be added to this platform to support other wearable scenarios.

In this study, we demonstrate the capability to produce photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using this platform. To adhere to a low power budget for solar-powering, a 574nm green light source is used where the PPG from the radial artery would be obtained with minimal signal conditioning. The system incorporates two monocrystalline solar cells to charge the onboard 20mAh lithium polymer battery. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used to tether the device to a smartphone that makes the phone an access point to a dedicated server for long term continuous storage of data. Two power management schemes have been proposed depending on the availability of solar energy. In low light situations, if the battery is low, the device obtains a 5-second PPG waveform every minute to consume an average power of 0.57 mW. In scenarios where the battery is at a sustainable voltage, the device is set to enter its normal 30 Hz acquisition mode, consuming around 13.7 mW. We also present our efforts towards improving the charge storage capacity of our on-board super-capacitor.

By replacing manual operations with automatic machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, iVS aims to enhance reliability, save time and costs for patient's monitoring routines carried out in hospitals, clinics and emergency sites. Using advanced wireless communication technologies, it also allows medical staff to access to patient health conditions and other information (e.g., medications, prescriptions, medical treatment history, etc.) from EHR from anywhere at anytime in order to have fast and efficient responses to emergency situations. Network architecture and system design of iVS are first presented. M2M communication protocols to enable inter-operable data exchange between various system entities are explained. Theoretical maximum user data throughput that can be obtained over the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication link connecting patient monitors and smartphones is also calculated.

The described potential, so-called Human Dynamics, pursues to describe in real-time the human behaviours and activities. These goals are starting to be feasible through the quantity of data provided by two of the main areas of the Internet of Things, on the one hand, the Smart cities to make more intelligent the environment and offer a smart space that sense our movements, actions, and the evolution of the ecosystem, and on the other hand, the wearable and mobile computing which allows to provide data from the humans itself, i.e., from their pockets (smart phones), wrists (smart watches), hearts (wearable sensors), and eyes (glasses). This work analyses the ecosystem defined through the triangle formed by Big Data, Smart Cities and Wearable Computing to determinate human dynamics. For this purpose, the life-cycle of human dynamics determinations in Smart Cities have been analysed in order to determinate the current status of the technology, challenges, and opportunities.

The 31*45 mm(2) module supports simultaneous acquisition on maximum 8 channels with an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 20.9 at most and a sampling rate of up to 32KSPS each. Also we implement two popular modes of wireless transmission featuring high data rate and low power, namely a transmission rate of 21.3Kbps using Bluetooth low energy (BLE, power consumption 30mW) and 263Kbps using WiFi (723mW). Additionally, two typical wireless sensing applications, floor vibration detection and electrocardiograph (ECG) signal acquisition, are tested to demonstrate the performance of this platform. Results show that the characteristic of this platform can primely satisfy the requirements of these applications featuring high resolution, low power and high-efficient wireless data transmission, which is greatly helpful for exploring-stage experiments in wireless sensing application cases.

However, the system design and verification methodologies that capture the complexity of multistandard RF SoC's are still limited. In this paper, an HDL design methodology is introduced for multistandard RF SoC's, which covers all the design layers from system design, to automatic extraction of the models from circuits and a systematic top level verification. The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology. The accuracy of the system level simulations show a very good match with the measurement results after fabrication. The test SoC is fabricated with 0.13 mu m CMOS technology.

Three types of wireless sensor technologies (Bluetooth, ZigBee, and ANT) have been used to monitor the biomechanical and physiological activities of bicycles and cyclists, respectively. However, the wireless monitoring of these activities has faced some challenges. The aim of this paper is to highlight various methodologies for monitoring cycling to provide an effective and efficient way to overcome the various challenges and limitations of sports cycling using wireless sensor interfaces. Several design criteria were reviewed and compared with different solutions for the implementation of current WSN research, such as low power consumption, long distance communications, small size, and light weight. Conclusions were drawn after observing the example of an advanced and adaptive network technology (ANT) network highlighting reduced power consumption and prolonged battery life. The power saving achieved in the slave node was 88-95% compared to the similar ANT protocol used in the medical rehabilitation.

Following this concept, a novel many-to-many authentication scheme based on passive NFC tags is proposed. In contradiction to existing solutions that assume a wireless key to be a battery-powered device with considerable computational power, we suggest to use a passive NFC tag in order to minimise the key size and significantly reduce the costs. The security of all the information on the tag is guaranteed by a specific data encryption scheme constructed on top of strong cryptographic primitives. In our approach, all the computations are performed by the service user is authenticating in, and thus no computational power and no battery on the key side is needed. This comes to an user-friendly, secure and cost-efficient solution. Moreover, the system core - proposed encryption scheme could be easily applied to any other carrier technologies, as, for example, to Bluetooth Low Energy or Wireless USB. Having generalised our solution to hold an integrity property, it can also be used for another emerging application - secure documents storage.

We can acquire basic kinematics and dynamics mechanism parameters (spatial position, speed, acceleration, vibration, angular rate, orientation, etc.) and some environment condition (local/remote temperature, humidity, pressure, electromagnetic noise) by MEMS sensors. Acquired data are sent to remote application in desktop computer. This system can replace expensive and separate diagnostic tools by small integrated solution with one wireless communication interface (with limitation of MEMS sensors precision). This solution can be battery powered with long operation time, because there is used new wireless technology based on Bluetooth 4 protocol (Low Energy/Smart Bluetooth). Some of integrated MEMS sensors measures same variable on different measuring principle. For example angle can be acquired from three different sensors: magnetometer, accelerometer or gyroscope. Combination of these sensor data can significantly improve value accuracy. The designed diagnostic tool can serve as an inertia measuring unit IMU or Wireless IMU (WIMU).

An iBeacon is a Bluetooth Low Energy device that only sends a signal in a specific format. They are like a lighthouse that sends light signals to boats. This paper explains what an iBeacon is, how it works and how it can simplifiy your daily life, what restriction comes with iBeacon and how to improve this restriction., as well as, how to use Location-based Services to track items. E.g., every time you touchdown at an airport and wait for your suitcase at the luggage reclaim, you have no information when your luggage will arrive at the conveyor belt. With an iBeacon inside your suitcase, it is possible to track the luggage and to receive a push notification about it even before you can see it. This is just one possible solution to use them. iBeacon can create a completely new shopping experience or make your home smarter. This paper demonstrates the luggage tracking use case and evaluates its possibilities and restrictions.

The hardware components of the mobile devices are renewed almost every six months. however the smartphones still cannot stay awake for more than one day. This is one of the biggest problem today both in the mobile industry and among users as well. The engineers try to reduce the energy usage not just through hardware optimization but also software solutions are made. These solutions are mostly unsuitable for everyday usage, but what happens if we optimize the energy consumption based on the most frequent user habits? The users usually use their devices to be continuously notified about the latest messages, activities, phone calls etc. This behavior can be sometimes unnecessary, for example during the night it is not important to synchronize all e-mails of the users. From that point of view, the users and their devices can form a socio-cognitive channel, which can help to create behavior-based technologies. In this paper we introduce a model which represents the most common smartphone usage scenarios using Markov chains. Based on this model we make suggestions how the processes can be modified to improve the energy consumption of the mobile devices.

The proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e. g. respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. We introduce the use of accelerometer sensor to detect changes in the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest; whereas these changes provide an accurate measurement of respiration rate as well as tidal volume variability. The complete system was comprised of wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. The experiments are conducted with 8 subjects and the overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.2% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also present a method for Tidal Volume variability (TVvar) estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. The mean value of the correlation coefficient between TVvar derived from the accelerometer and spirometer for all subjects and three breath patterns is 0.87 which shows a high correspondence of two signals. Furthermore, the results indicate that the accelerometer driven TVvar achieves the average MSE 1.6E-03 +/- 3.69E-03 compared to the reference.

Two methods of quantization are proposed in this paper: uniform and non-uniform. Reconstruction is performed using a dictionary based on the Mexican Hat wavelet. A distortion-based performance metric Percent Root-mean-squared Difference (PRD) will be monitored at various Compression Ratios (CR) to quantify the impact of quantization. The energy cost of transmission is also evaluated for different levels of quantization and compared, at certain PRD levels. The results demonstrate that non-uniform quantization outperforms the uniform approach and that employing non-uniform quantization improves implementation efficiency for applications with acceptable PRDs above 6.75%. Results show that utilizing non-uniform quantization can increase the CR from 9.8 to 14.1 for a PRD of 30%. Furthermore, this amounts to a 28.91% reduction in wireless transmission per frame from 37.7 mu J to 26.8 mu J considering Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a target wireless communication protocol.

The technology has been adapted in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, medical devices, and electrical household equipment. BLE introduces a simplified channel-hopping algorithm as an alternative to Classic Bluetooth-one that masks unfair usage of available spectrum. This paper details a simulation of BLE's data channel selection algorithm. The authors describe a pseudo-code for simulation software to calculate selection probability for each data channel. Results demonstrate that data channels in a BLE system are not selected equitably and the algorithm is more inclined to select data channels with indices between 1 and 21. The probability of collision between multiple BLE communicating pairs is found to be higher than that of Classic Bluetooth which results in a reduced maximum achievable aggregate throughput of 3.18 Mbps.

However, the complexity of the protocol and the lack of the simulation tools impedes the studies of BLE network performance. For this reason, in the paper we introduce the novel simulation tool, which is capable of simulating the communication in the networks of BLE devices. In the paper we discuss the capabilities and limitations of the suggested tool and compare the results of the simulations with the ones obtained with the real-life hardware BLE transceivers.

The simplified link control layer and concise packet structure make it very appealing to low power applications with medium data rate requirement. However, the very short preamble of a BLE packet is also present as a new design challenge. In such a burst data communication scenario, a short preamble means that only a very short time interval is allowed to adjust the gain of the receiver analog front end to condition the input signal strength to a proper level for decent demodulation in the digital baseband. Aiming at this problem, a fast convergence two-stage automatic gain control (AGC) loop is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is explained in details, and the performance is verified via simulation.

However, no single connectivity technology satisfies fast service execution with low power discovery because agile service delivery fundamentally requires consuming high power. Therefore, we propose a synergetic multi-connectivity strategy utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) discovery and Wi-Fi Peer to Peer (P2P) fast connection for agile service delivery. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive BLE discovery algorithm to enhance the discovery performance. Finally, the experiment of the multi-connectivity scheme and the theoretical simulation of the discovery algorithm show that the proposed approach excellently provides the fast service delivery with low power discovery.

This study investigates the impact that stray wireless transmissions from residential microwave ovens have on the BLE component of the body area network. The results of this study may lead to improvements and widespread use of body area network medical systems, which may lead to better monitoring, more data, and fewer fatalities due to misdiagnosed heart conditions.

As the healthcare cost is increasing and the population is aging, unobtrusive, low cost and accurate healthcare systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare. They are convenient to use, and can be utilized directly from home or community. These systems have various functionalities, such as bio-signal monitoring, signal analysis and biofeedback. They are consist of subsystems including sensors, data aggregators, data processing units, connected by wired or wireless communication modules. The developing goal of the systems includes to increase the performance accuracy, to make the system smaller, to prolong the battery life and to lower the product cost. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), comparing to traditional wired or other wireless communication modules, is beneficial for these design goals. Devices with bluetooth low energy are attracting more scientists and engineers in research and are changing individuals' lives with products such as wearable sport bends, smart toothbrushes, and intelligent watches. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art Bluetooth low energy technology. Further, we list and analyze the most popular commercial products and the available developing tools.

Many other SE systems to date support remote control and automation but not access control, making them applicable to homes but not offices or other public settings. Even if they implement access control, virtually all existing SE systems suffer from central point of failure. To address these problems, we propose a new SE system that supports not only access control but also distributed access from multiple devices without relying on centralized control. In addition to access-control list, we also take advantage of the proximity tag feature supported by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol without requiring users to take out their identifying BLE devices from their pockets as one would have to do with RFID tags. Experimental results show that our SE system to offer the security features required for public deployment with minimal power, latency, and cost overhead.

EcoBT Super-node is a full-sized node with an on-board digital accelerometer with rich expansion ports, while EcoBT Mini is the miniature version merely 8x8 mm(2) in area. Included on both nodes are a digital accelerometer with programmable threshold detection for power saving, real-time clock, magnetic switches for contactless operation, and low-load DC-DC converters for low stand-by power when used in conjunction with a rechargeable Lithium-polymer battery. The use of BLE enables direct communication with a BLE-equipped smartphone, tablet, or laptop without the inconvenience of a dongle or an extra gateway device. These two platforms share the identical microcontroller unit (MCU), enabling code sharing between them with little or no porting effort. The versatility of these platforms is being demonstrated in several real-life applications ranging from temperature tracking in shipping containers and lighting control to and several wearable medical devices.

The present study implements a low-cost and convenient monitoring system for patients with breathing problems or sleep disorders. We have also captured the Rib Cage (RC) and Abdomen (AB) movements using accelerometer sensors. In addition to measurement of phase shift between the chest wall compartments, the impacts of different body positions on AB and RC motions have been investigated. The performance of the presented system is evaluated and the average Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.14 is achieved for three breath timing variables. Moreover, the overall errors of phase angles for paradoxical and synchronous breath patterns are 0.25 degrees +/- 0.06 and 0.26 degrees +/- 6E-03, respectively. The system properly indicates a significant increase in the degree of ribcage and abdomen asynchrony in the paradoxical breathing compared to normal pattern.

This paper presents the use of flexible capacitive tactile sensing arrays for concurrent monitoring of biopotential and wetness. This has been enabled by designing the cross-section of the capacitive sensor in a specific "H" shape where the movement of the capacitive plates is used for estimating the presence and the value of tactile forces. The capacitive plates act as biopotential sensors when coupled to the skin and the presence of conductive fluids in-between the plates can be sensed through impedance spectroscopy. We have designed a preliminary miniaturized circuit front-end using commercial-of-the-shelf components to interface the sensors and wirelessly transmit the data through a Bluetooth low energy link. Using the designed circuitry, the force applied to the pixel in the array has been estimated through capacitive sensing with a linear change in the capacitance with the applied force. Same sensor was used to detect EKG waveforms and sense the presence of wetness and salinity using impedance characterization.

In this paper, we propose a received signal strength indication (RSSI) based Bluetooth positioning method. There are two phases in the procedure of our positioning: offline training and online locating. In the phase of offline training, we use piecewise fitting based on the lognormal distribution model to train the propagation model of RSSI for every BLE reference nodes, respectively, in order to reduce the influence of the positioning accuracy because of different locations of BLE reference nodes. Here we design a Gaussian filter to pre-process the receiving signals in different sampling points. In the phase of online locating, we use weighted sliding window to reduce fluctuations of the real-time signals. In addition, we propose a distance weighted filter based on triangle trilateral relations theorem, which can reduce the influence of positioning accuracy due to abnormal RSSI and improve the location accuracy effectively. Besides, in order to reduce the errors of targets coordinates caused by ordinary least squares method, we propose a collaborative localization algorithm based on Taylor series expansion. Another important feature of our method is the active learning ability of BLE reference nodes. Every reference node adjusts its pre-trained model according to the received signals from detecting nodes actively and periodically, which improve the accuracy of positioning greatly. Experiments show that the probability of locating error less than 1.5 meter is higher than 80% using our positioning method.

However, the collaboration between TV and companion applications faces challenges that go beyond traditional single screen applications. These range from discovery, wake-up and pairing of devices, to application launch, communication, synchronization and adaptation to target device and screen size. In this position paper, we will limit ourselves to two of these aspects and introduce an idea for a new wake-up and synchronization mechanism for Multiscreen applications using iBeacon technology.

Despite the competition from ANT+, ZigBee, Nike+, NFC and RF4CE, in 2010 the Bluetooth SIG (special interest groups) adopted a new wireless technology named Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE coexist with Bluetooth in the same chip (called dual mode) therefore assuring this technology a rapid growth among smartphones, iOS, tablets, laptops and PCs. In fact, Bluetooth SIG also announced that it shall be hard to find a smartphone or tablet-PC that does not integrate BLE in the near future. Despite this accelerated growth, BLE shares the same band with Wi-Fi and all other low power technologies, so in order to achieve QoS, a mandatory requirement in many systems, tests for interference and coexistence must be performed. This study analysis the impact of a BLE sensor network on a crowded 2.4GHz room, with multiple Wi-Fi routers, ZigBee sensors and Bluetooth technology. We also compare the results with the ones obtained inside an anechoic chamber on similar experiences.

Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization.

Three micro-power generators have already been developed as part of a smart hip prosthesis structure. This paper outlines a power management architecture for efficient harvesting of energy to supply power to modules other than those powered by current instrumented implants. Considering that it is impossible to predict the amount of energy harvested by each particular person, the proposed system also comprises an activation circuit and its ultracapacitor energy reservoir as a fourth type of energy to be used when a continuous energy source is needed. The hip prosthesis prototype has now the capability to energize more power demanding loads, intermittently or continuously, such as radio-frequency modules. The proposed architecture enables operation of a Bluetooth low energy (V4.0) embedded device (BLE112 from Bluegiga), part of a wireless body sensor network, up to 50 s, and a MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 (Texas Instruments), which uses the SimpliciTl communication protocol, up to 110 s, solely using the energy produced by one of the generators.

The receiver employs a passive front-end zero-IF architecture, which is directly driven by a quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) without any buffering stage. The QVCO, embedded in a fractional-phase-locked loop (PLL), employs a passive network to cancel the parasitic magnetic coupling between the two cores so as to keep the quadrature phase error below 1.5 degrees. The PLL exhibits a high loop bandwidth of 1 MHz to sufficiently reduce the frequency pulling effects due to close-by interferers. The transmitter uses a direct-modulation Gaussian frequency-shift keying scheme in which small PMOS-based cells modulate the output signal of one of the cores of the QVCO. In the baseband section, the transceiver employs a 4-bit phase-domain ADC based on novel linear-combiner topology to generate the required phase rotations. The proposed combiner operates in current domain and does not employ resistors, leading to a power- and area-efficient demodulator implementation. The complete receiver achieves a sensitivity of -81.4 dBm and fulfills the BLE requirements on interference blocking. It consumes 1.1 mW from a 1.0-V supply and has a similar power efficiency as recent super-regenerative receivers that are much more susceptible to interferers. The transmitter delivers 1.6-dBm output power to a differential 100 Omega and consumes 5.9 mW, which implies a total efficiency of 24.5%.

Thus far, researchers have tried to adapt various short range technologies such as IEEE802.15.4, classical Bluetooth etc., to achieve this goal. The IEEE802.15.4 was, by excellence, widely deployed because of its low power and its security features compared to technologies such as the classical Bluetooth. However, the Bluetooth Special Interest group has recently announced Bluetooth 4.0 with low energy technology (BLE) for low power personal area networked devices, which offers more compelling features in various aspects when compared to IEEE802.15.4. This makes its evaluation for healthcare applications an urgently needed endeavour. In this paper, we present a BLE-based remote health monitoring system in which we have interfaced an ECG simulator directly to a BLE enabled CC2540 wireless sensor node (a system-on-chip (SoC) for Bluetooth low energy applications, from Texas Instruments). The node acts as a slave to the Master BLE device. In our system, we have used a BLE112 module (from Bluegiga) as a slave node while for the master we have used a BLE USB dongle connected to a PC in order to manage data received from the sensor node. A server application running on the PC uses a TCP-based connection over the network interface in order to enable remote monitoring. Any remote client can connect to the server and receives live updates from the sensor node. We have developed a LabVIEW based TCP client application to provide this functionality. An ECG simulator was used to generate ECG signals for different heartbeat rates that were sent through the BLE enabled network. The waveforms received at remote station using the developed system were found to conform exactly to those captured using a high resolution oscilloscope. (C) 2013 The Authors.

A Comparative Analysis of BLE and 6LoWPAN For U-HealthCare Applications	2013 7TH IEEE GCC CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (GCC)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)	NOV 17-20, 2013	Doha, QATAR	IEEE		U-healthcare system; BLE; Zigbee; IEEE 802.15.4; 6LoWPAN		For decades, there exist a variety of low-power wireless technologies deployed for healthcare applications such as Zigbee/IEEE802.15.4, Bluetooth, ANT, NFC, IrDA. However, the recently announced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology claims to offer many new compelling features and is expected to get wide adoption by many mobile manufacturers around the world and hence be included in daily life mobile devices. Therefore, it is important to provide future adopters with a thorough yet insightful evaluation of this technology as contrasted to competing ones in the market today. In this paper, we present such evaluation from an experimental point of view as well as referring to technical specifications from manufacturers. The discussion is geared toward assessing the extent to which theses technologies can meet the stringent requirements for u-healthcare applicability. BLE and 6LoWPAN showed greater potentials for such applicability in terms of power demand, bit rate and latency. Nevertheless, BLE was found to be most robust to obstacles and was operable using single coin cell.

This paper contains validation results of a wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) patch sensor consisting of two electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes, a microcontroller, a tri-axial accelerometer, and a BLE transceiver. The sensor measures heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, posture, steps, and falls and was evaluated on a total of 25 adult participants who performed breathing exercises, activities of daily living (ADLs), various stretches, stationary cycling, walking/running, and simulated falls. Compared to reference devices, the heart rate measurement had a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 2 bpm, time-domain HRV measurements had an RMS error of less than 15 ms, respiratory rate had an MAE of 1.1 breaths per minute during metronome breathing, posture detection had an accuracy of over 95 % in two of the three patch locations, steps were counted with an absolute error of less than 5 %, and falls were detected with a sensitivity of 95.2 % and specificity of 100%.

In this paper we present the development of the next stage of the SmartShoe evolution - SmartStep, a physical activity monitor that is fully integrated into an insole, maximizing convenience and social acceptance of the monitor. Encapsulating the sensors, Bluetooth Low Energy wireless interface and the energy source within an assembly repeatedly loaded with high forces created during ambulation presented new design challenges. In this preliminary study we tested the ability of the SmartStep to measure the pressure differences between static weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing activities (such as no load vs. sitting vs. standing) as well as capture pressure variations during walking. We also measured long-term stability of the sensors and insole assembly under cyclic loading in a mechanical testing system.

For over a decade, the demand for a new low power wireless standard has been growing worldwide for various commercial applications, such as home and building automation, health, sports and fitness, medical, sensor networking, and even the automotive field. Electronic wireless sensors are connected to smart devices of patients using wireless connectivity systems, such as Bluetooth which is classified into two main technologies: classic-Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE is an emerging low-power wireless technology that is expected to be used to communicate with electronic wireless sensors in the medical field. Devices using BLE wireless technology are expected to consume a fraction of the power of classic-Bluetooth enabled products for Bluetooth communication. In many cases, products will be able to operate for more than a year on a coin cell battery without recharging. That will allow sensors such as thermometers to operate continuously, communicating intermittently with other devices such as smart devices. This may increase the concerns for privacy, because remote, low-power, continuously on sensors would be present in devices with BLE.

Currently available pointing devices based on MEMS sensors (AIR mouse or AIR presenter) use proprietary wireless solution and their dimensions are copied from standard mouse. The new approach of our pointing device is based on standardized Bluetooth Low Energy protocol with minimal dimension and 3D way of control. This device can be used like a standard mouse in 2D with computer equipped by Bluetooth 4. The third measured dimension can be used to switch X or Y axis to Z plane, because we can control pointer without flat surface. The change of 2D pointing plane from XY to YZ or XZ can be switched intelligent by detection of acceleration activity in third axis. The device in full 3D mode will be used for control of rehabilitation arm in teaching mode by patient or therapist.

A Viterbi algorithm (VA) based soft decision is implemented with multiple bits differential discriminator to fully utilize the dynamical range. The whole digital circuit is verified and synthesized in ASICs, and its BER performance against channel noise is measured through FPGA with the Bluetooth receiver chip. Compared to hard- decision and decision feedback equalizer (DFE) methods, measurement results show that the proposed demodulator gains a large advantage in Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) communications where power efficiency and implementation complexity are of primary concern.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for advertising information related to physical objects in the user vicinity. There are three distinctive features in our approach. First, ubiquitous codes (ucodes) are used for providing globally unique identifiers for the physical objects. Second, we use Bluetooth Low Energy beacons for broadcasting the identifiers of the physical objects. Third, the information related to the physical object is represented with semantic technologies. In order to verify our approach we have developed an example application for iPhone 4S. The application presents the current physical objects in the user vicinity and shows selected information about these objects.

One of limitations of BLE is the support for data transferring over only a single hop. In the paper, we suggest the mechanism enabling the multihop data transfers between the nodes in BLE networks. To ensure portability, the suggested mechanism is designed as BLE service, which uses only the integral components of BLE stack. We discuss in details the suggested multihop service, its implementation and present the results of evaluation, which confirm feasibility and reveal features of the suggested solution. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first implementation of the multihop data transfer over the BLE networks.

Since BLE is well designed in favor of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) or Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), fast network access has been considered an important issue for users. This paper studies the performance about BLE device discovery particularly with multiple devices. An analytical model is developed, based on classical ALOHA analysis, in consideration of three advertising channels of BLE. In addition, an enhanced mechanism is proposed enabling BLE scanner/initiator to learn the network contention and adjust parameters accordingly, so as to achieve lower latency. Through extensive simulations, the model has been validated highly accurate, and the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in reducing unexpected long latency in crowd BLE networks.

As a low-power wireless solution, BLE provides attractive energy performance that makes it particularly suitable for portable, battery-driven electronic devices. Although there are some prior arts focusing on BLE energy performance, it still lacks a thorough study on the important aspect of device discovery. Such energy cost, introduced by intermittent scanning or connection setup, could seriously affect the battery endurance ability of the devices. In this paper, we present quantitative analysis on the neighbor discovery energy for BLE. The modeling results that built upon measurement of CC2541 Mini-Development Kit have been validated quite accurate via extensive experiments. In addition, several interesting conclusions are found while investigating the achieved energy model, which may provide precious guidelines to the design of energy-efficient applications for BLE.

As far as we know, we implemented the first prototype system to transmit IPv6 packets over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based on BlueZ, the official Bluetooth stack of Linux. To adapt IPv6 packets to BLE link, in addition to the implementation of segmentation and reassembly (SAR), header compression (HC) is effective to improve the transmission efficiency and achieve lower power consumption. The 6LoWPAN workgroup of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed several standards and drafts to specify the header compression scheme for IPv6 packet delivery in low power wireless networks. Based on the compression format defined in RFC6282, we proposed a new mechanism for the management of contexts, which can improve both power efficiency and time efficiency, extend the content of context information and provide better flexibility.

This poses a challenge for RF and antenna design required for wireless operation. In this work, the radio interface design for a 2.4 GHz wireless sensor including a discrete filter balun circuit and an antenna operating at 0.3 mm distance from the body is presented. Thin, lightweight single-layer structure is realized using printed electronics manufacturing technology. The RF and antenna designs are validated by measurements, and a sensor with a fully functional radio interface is implemented and verified. At 0.3 mm from the body, 2.4 dB insertion loss and - 10 dBi realized gain at 2.4 GHz were achieved for a discrete filter balun and antenna, respectively. The received power level on a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) channel was above -80 dBm at 1 m distance from the body, indicating capability for short-range off-body communications. The paper also provides guidelines for printed electronics RF and antenna design for on-body operation.

The main goal is monitoring of selected physiological processes that might be very useful in health care and monitoring during sport activities. The monitoring device, based on an on-body sensor, is designed with respect to small size, low power consumption as well as interoperability. Therefore, it is equipped with a microcontroller with RF module for ZigBee PRO or ANT+ networks. Measured data is sent through the wireless network to an acquisition point, which collects the data and transfers it to a database server. Here, the data is stored and can be accessed remotely via internet. This system is mainly aimed at home health care, so it should be able to communicate with standard personal devices such as cellphone, notebook/netbook, PC, tablet, etc. For this reason, the acquisition point is able to communicate via Bluetooth standard as well as Bluetooth low energy (for future use). Through this network, user can view live data as well as data stored in the database server. As an example, the system for monitoring of psycho-galvanic reflex of the human skin will be shown. The communication between the acquisition point and sensor is based on ZigBee PRO network and communication between the acquisition point and visualization device uses Bluetooth network, since recently, this is the most common interface used in portable devices.

Thereby, BLE makes feasible the wireless transmission of information from smart objects such as wearable clinical devices, ambient sensors and actuators. These smart objects are starting to be internet-enabled devices, reaching the so denominated Internet of Things (IoT). Our research work is focused on analyze the capabilities of these technologies for continuous data transmission and integration of clinical sensors in home-care and Ambient Assisted Living environments. For this purpose, this work analyses exhaustively the capabilities from BLE and compare this with the capabilities from Bluetooth 2.1. In addition, it has been considered the communications requirements from different clinical devices such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a capnograph. It is concluded that the performance from BLE is lower than Bluetooth Classic (Bluetooth 2.1) for continuous communications, since BLE is based on attributes (datapoints) transfer instead of offering a communication session where can be transmitted as much packets as required, without any size constraint. Therefore, it is necessary to perform data compression/aggregation when the amount of data to send is too large to be stored in a BLE attribute. This work also presents how to apply pre-processing techniques that greatly reduces the transmission overload (performs signal compression) in order to allow the continuous transmission of the ECG and capnograph signal through BLE making so feasible the integration of continuous clinical devices via BLE.

Operating in the 2.36 GHz Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs) and the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific & Medical (ISM) frequency bands, the transceiver implements rotated differential-phase shift keying (DPSK) and Gaussian filtered frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation for both IEEE 802.15.6 Narrow Band (NB) and Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE) PHY standards. Also included is a proprietary 900 MHz ISM band transmitter utilizing FSK modulation. The wireless transceiver operates half-duplex, and for IEEE 802.15.6 achieves -104/-96.5 dBm receiver input sensitivity (for 10% packet error rate) at data rates of 121.4/971.4 kbps and -94 dBm for Bluetooth LE (for 0.1% bit error rate) at 1 Mbps. Transmit power up to +3/+5 dBm is achievable for IEEE 802.15.6 and Bluetooth LE respectively. The transceiver consumes 4.8 mA during IEEE 802.15.6 & Bluetooth LE receive, and 4.6 mA during Bluetooth LE transmit at -10 dBm output power, from a 1.0 V supply. For IEE802.15.6 transmission at -10 dBm output power, 5.9 mW is consumed, dropping to 1.7mW for proprietary 900 MHz transmission. This performance surpasses state-of-the-art power consumption and represents the first published transceiver for the IEEE 802.15.6 NB PHY standard. It is fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology and occupies approximately 5.9 mm(2).

An Empirical Performance Study of Intra-vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks under WiFi and Bluetooth Interference	2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2013	Atlanta, GA	IEEE		Intra-vehicular; intra-car; wireless sensor network; IVWSN; ZigBee; Bluetooth; WiFi; interference	ZIGBEE	Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Network (IVWSN) is a new automotive architecture that applies wireless technologies to the communications between Electrical Control Units (ECUs) and sensors. It can potentially help achieve better fuel economy, reduce wiring complexity, and support additional new applications. In the existing works, most of the popular wireless technologies applied on IVWSNs occupy the same 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands as WiFi and Bluetooth do. It is therefore essential to evaluate the performance of IVWSNs under interference from WiFi and Bluetooth devices, especially when these devices are inside the vehicle. In this paper, we report the results of a comprehensive experimental study of IVWSNs based on ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy under WiFi and Bluetooth interference. The impact of the interference from Bluetooth and WiFi devices can be clearly observed from the experiments. The results of the experiments conducted suggest that Bluetooth Low Energy technology outperforms ZigBee technology in the context of IVWSNs when WiFi interference exists in the car.

Evaluation of Fall Risk for Post-Stroke Patients Using Bluetooth Low-Energy Wireless Sensor	2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2013	Atlanta, GA	IEEE			FUNCTIONAL REACH; STROKE; CONSEQUENCES; SURVIVORS; FEAR	The widespread need to assess fall risk has generated need for a reliable, inexpensive, and quantifiable clinical measure. In this paper, we propose mStroke, a practical, accurate, and mobile health system that remotely measures fall risk estimation for post stroke patients. Our proposed system is delivered as an application (App) running on our hardware system consisting of two bluetooth low energy (BLE) modular sensor devices and a smartphone. This system uses accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to measure fall risk within the functional reach test, an accurate single-tasked clinical tool for fall risk assessment. The proposed system has been extensively tested using emulated and real data from Physical Therapy students as well as stroke patients.

We provide experimental data comparing power consumption of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and ANT protocols for a cyclic sleep scenario, in which a short-range and low-power wireless sensor node periodically sends a data packet to a remote 'hub' with intervening sleep intervals. Devices such as wearable health monitors often use this scenario when interfacing with a mobile phone-based hub. For all measured sleep intervals BLE achieved lower power consumption (10.1 uA, 3.3 V supply at 120 s interval), compared with ZigBee (15.7 uA), and ANT (28.2 uA). Most of the power consumption differences can be attributed to the time taken for a node to connect to the hub after waking up and the use of sleep between individual RF packets. For the three protocols we determined a sleep interval at which the trade-off between power consumption and data rate is optimized.

This has resulted in an increase in the number, weight and complexity of wiring as well as wiring harness for in-vehicle communication networks. Reducing the amount of cables will improve fuel efficiency; reduce cost of manufacturing and maintenance of vehicles greatly. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a great candidate for cable replacement given its supported data rates and widespread adoption in many markets. BLE device discovery is required to establish the presence of nodes within each other's communication range and begin reliable exchange of data. In our system, the nodes are the sensors and actuators. The fundamental problem in such device discovery is that energy consumption and discovery latency are inversely related. Therefore an efficient trade-off BLE connection setup that reduces energy-consumption while being able to provide worst-case discovery latency guarantees is critical especially in the automotive industry. We propose a mechanism that exploits Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to provide worst-case latency guarantees during the connection setup phase of BLE devices. We provide the required modifications in BLE as well as provide evaluation results to show the improved performance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that considers providing bounded-latency connection setup for BLE devices using CRT and its application for automotive cable replacement.

The system uses Apple iPhone4s and TI CC2540 which supports BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) specification to realize short-range communications. On the one hand, vehicle BCM (Body Control Module) with CC2540 collects the car information by CAN in real-time. On the other hand, the smartphone connects CC2540 to control the vehicle and to display the information on smartphone interface using BLE technology. The Apple iPhone4s' application is on the base of X-code4.5 development platform with iOS6.

The Ph-ADC linearly combines the in-phase and quadrature parts of the incoming signal, and the generated phase-shifted versions are fed to comparators to detect the zero-crossings and build a 4-b digital representation of the signal phase. Seeking for a low-area and low-power consumption realization, our proposal employs a resistor-less scheme which performs phase rotations in current domain. Together with the Ph-ADC, the fully integrated GFSK demodulator also includes a channel-filtering programmable gain amplifier and a symbol decision block. Altogether, the demodulator occupies 0.14 mm(2) in a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology with a total power consumption of 190 mu W from a 1-V supply. For a data rate of 1 Mbps and 0.5 modulation depth, the GFSK demodulator requires an E-B/N-o of 14.8 dB for a bit error rate of 0.1% considering a flicker noise corner of 150 kHz, obtains a dynamic range of 74 dB, and is able to tolerate carrier frequency offsets of +/- 170 kHz. This performance safely complies with the requirements of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.

J	Gomez, C; Oller, J; Paradells, J				Gomez, Carles; Oller, Joaquim; Paradells, Josep			Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; sensor networks; Internet of Things	PERSONAL AREA NETWORKS; SYSTEM; IP	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 mu s, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.

The model can be used to determine some important performance metrics, such as average latency or average energy consumption during the course of discovering neighbors. Since intermittent connections are frequently encountered in practical scenarios of BLE, the modeling results can provide a beneficial guidance to customize advertising or scanning behavior towards user desired performance.

J	Adibi, S				Adibi, Sasan			Link Technologies and BlackBerry Mobile Health (mHealth) Solutions: A Review	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Review						BlackBerry; Bluetooth; Bluetooth low energy (BTLE); ZigBee; eHealth; end-to-end; mHealth; mobile systems; security; sensor	FEASIBILITY; SERVICE	The number of wearable wireless sensors is expected to grow to 400 million by the year 2014, while the number of operational mobile subscribers has already passed the 5.2 billion mark in 2011. This growth results in an increasing number of mobile applications including: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, Electronic-Health (eHealth), and Mobile-Health (mHealth). A number of emerging mobile applications that require 3G and 4G mobile networks for data transport relate to telemedicine, including establishing, maintaining, and transmitting health-related information, research, education, and training. This review paper takes a closer look at these applications, specifically with regard to the healthcare industry and their underlying link technologies. The authors believe that the BlackBerry platform and the associated infrastructure (i.e., BlackBerry Enterprise Server) is a logical and practical solution for eHealth, mHealth, sensor and M2M deployments, which are considered in this paper.

Bluetooth v4.0 is the latest version of a wireless communication standard for low-speed and low-range data transfer among devices in a human's PAN. It allows increased network mobility among devices such as headsets, PDAs, wireless keyboards and mice. A pairing process is initiated when two devices desire to communicate, and this pairing needs to correctly authenticate devices so that a secret link key is established for secure communication. What is interesting is that device authentication relies on humans to communicate verification information between devices via a human-aided out-of-band channel. Bluetooth v4.0's SSP protocol is designed to offer security against passive eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. We conduct the first known detailed analysis of SSP for all its MitM-secure models. We highlight some issues related to exchange of public keys and use of the passkey in its models and discuss how to treat them properly.

The carrier frequency is set with a finite-modulo fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) in order to achieve a low start-up time of 5.5 mu s. The LC-based VCO is directly modulated using simple pMOS transistors to change the tank capacitance. Measurements verify that the carrier frequency and the frequency deviation meet the requirements of the Bluetooth low energy standard up to 85 degrees C even considering supply voltage variations of 1.0 V +/- 10%. The FSK synthesizer only consumes 600 mu W and drives a power amplifier (PA) with a differential class-E output stage. An integrated step-up transformer is used to up-convert the antenna impedance to a load impedance of 840 Omega seen by the PA. The overall transmitter consumes 8.9 mA and delivers +1.9 dBm to the antenna, which means a total power efficiency of 17.4%.

As a promising radio, BT LE realizes many designing features to fulfill foreseeable requirements of short range communication, such as fast device discovery, power-saving transmitting, encryption and authentication, etc. In this paper, we focus on the modeling and performance analyzing of the device discovery process in BT LE networks. A general model for device discovery on multi-channel is proposed primarily, which is then tailored and simplified for the BT LE case, where three broadcasting channels are used. Via theoretical analysis, our study reveals that some potential pitfalls are residing in the current version of BT LE specification, i.e. improper parameter settings can significantly deteriorate the device discovery latency and increase meaningless energy consumption. We accordingly propose several strategies seeking ways to tackle the problem. The results of extensive simulation show that our strategies can largely reduce undesirable latency and effectively improve the efficiency of device discovery in BT LE networks.

For mobile applications, smartphones with Internet access have become a commonly used tool to make this data remotely accessible. However, the yet presented architectures are quite complex and lack flexibility. Our aim was to investigate how existing communication architectures for smartphone/WPAN sensor ensembles can be simplified and to provide a transparent solution where the smartphone doesn't require knowledge about sensors for which it serves as an Internet gateway. We therefore present an IP-based communication architecture, that allows applications to easily integrate remote sensor data of mobile users based on existing Internet standards. In particular, our solution provides simple Web service-based APIs and does not require the smartphone to process sensor data. Instead, the smartphone becomes a transparent gateway as it only forwards IP packets.

A capacitor cross-coupled common-gate LNA has been implemented. Due to the very low current consumption (1 mA @ 1.2 V) of the designed LNA, the standard deviation of the noise figure from the LNA circuit is dominated by process and mismatch. In this work, the reduction of standard deviation of the noise figure is achieved. The designed LNA achieves a noise figure of 3.2 dB and a voltage gain above 20 dB at all the bluetooth specified frequency ranges (2.4-2.483 GHz). The noise figure measurement with the whole receiver chain is done. The LNA fulfills the bluetooth system specifications and the measured power consumption is below 1.2 mW.

Apple's iPhone 4S is selected as the mobile device platform, which embedded with Bluetooth v4.0, Wi-Fi and iOS. In this paper, the monitoring system is able to acquire ECG signals through 2-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, transmit the ECG data via the Bluetooth wireless link, process and display the ECG waveform in a smart-phone. The results show that implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in the existing ECG monitoring system not only eliminates the physical constraints imposed by hard-wired link but also highly reduces the power consumption of the long-term monitoring system.

The emergence of technologies such as Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy, and embedded sensors has transformed simple physical devices into smart objects that can understand and react to their environment. Such smart objects form the building blocks for the Internet of Things. Although the need for security is widely accepted, there is no clear consensus on how IP-based Internet security protocols can be applied to resource-constrained smart object networks. In this paper, we develop a new secure and energy-efficient communication model for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a light-weight communication protocol designed for smart object networks. This architecture and the communication model ensures data integrity and authenticity over a multi-hop network topology. It provides a mirroring mechanism that uses a proxy to serve data on behalf of sleeping smart objects, thereby allowing them to act as always-online web servers. A working prototype implementation of the architecture is also developed. The security features in the architecture presented in this paper are based on using strong public-key cryptography. Contrary to popular belief, our performance evaluation shows that asymmetric public-key cryptography can be implemented on small 8-bit microcontrollers without modifying the underlying cryptographic algorithms using public libraries.			mohit@kth.se; jari.arkko@ericsson.com; ari.keranen@ericsson.com					Aranha D.

This apparatus is intended to establish the feasibility of harvesting ambient RF energy to power emerging ultra-low-power sensors and microcontrollers. We simultaneously acquire RF measurements from a spatial and polarization diversity antenna system, with both a spectrum analyzer (frequency-selective but slow), and a log amp (wideband but fast), explain key tradeoffs in the measurement configuration, and present a post-processing algorithm which provides a reliable characterization of the RF energy available in the 2.4GHz ISM band. Preliminary results suggest enough energy is available to support a low duty cycle wireless sensor node system. An average RF power of 11nW is observed 10m away from a typical Wi-Fi access point in an office environment, suggesting the possibility of low duty cycle, wirelessly powered sensing and communication using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or another ultra low power uplink.

This represents an increase of 28% new cases in one year. Diabetes Mellitus has become the most common chronic diseases in nearly all countries, and continues to increase in numbers and significance, as economic development and urbanization lead to changing lifestyles characterized by reduced physical activity, and increased obesity. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), is based on a set of technologies which aims to provide an enhanced support to people's daily life, namely the offer of new solutions for healthcare to improve the quality of life of the population and reduce costs associated with healthcare. This paper presents a Bluetooth prototype low power battery-less wireless sensor communication system capable transmitting the information to a mobile phone or wrist wireless phone. The purpose of the system is to gather routine information from the glucose monitoring system proposed by Leal, et al and interact with systems like Ambient Assisted Living from Martins, et al.

The sensor, which consists of a tri-axial accelerometer, a microcontroller and a Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, can be worn anywhere on a subject's torso and in any orientation. In order to distinguish easily between falls and activities of daily living (ADL), a possible fall is detected only if an impact is detected and if the subject is horizontal shortly afterwards. As an additional criterion to reduce false positives, a fall is confirmed if the user activity level several seconds after a possible fall is below a threshold. Intentional falls onto a gymnastics mat were performed by 10 volunteers (total of 297 falls); ADL were performed by 15 elderly volunteers (total of 315 ADL). The fall detection algorithm provided a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%.

In order to suffice power needs of a smart hip prosthesis, a prototype was built considering the use of two types of power sources: energy harvesting micro-power generators for intermittent implant electronics powering; wireless energy, by means of an activation system, responsible for, when needed, continuously powering the implant electronics and also configuring its mode of operation. Intermittently or continuously, it is now possible to energize more power demanding systems as the ones that uses a RF transceiver. The smart hip prosthesis can now become a wireless body sensor network node using LR-WPAN protocols such as Bluetooth low energy as is intended in this work. Preliminary results proved that is possible to energize a Bluetooth low energy module, for over 100 s, solely using the stored energy produced by one of the micro-power generators.

It is reasonable to apply wireless technologies for smart home networks, as they can be easily retrofitted in existing homes. Due to multipath propagation in indoor environments, wireless technologies have to cope with frequency selective fading. Thus, this paper presents an enhanced frequency hopping mechanism for reliable interconnection of low power smart home devices. The evaluations are based on the Bluetooth Low Energy standard. Different options are compared by evaluating the indoor coverage range, the energy consumption, and the latency.

In this paper, we quantify this notion using "proximity zone", and propose a methodology that empirically and systematically compare the proximity zones created by various wireless technologies. We find that existing technologies such as 802.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and RFID fall short on metrics such as boundary sharpness, robustness against interference, and obstacle penetration. We then present the design and evaluation of a wireless proximity detection platform based on magnetic induction - Live Synergy. Live Synergy provides sweet spot for indoor applications that require reliable and precise proximity detection. Finally, we present the design and evaluation of an end-to-end system, deployed inside a large food court to offer context-aware and personalized advertisements and diet suggestions at a per-counter granularity.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one promising candidate for such deployments. We study the energy consumption of BLE by measuring real devices with a power monitor and derive models of the basic energy consumption behavior observed from the measurement results. We investigate also the overhead of IPv6-based communication over BLE, which is relevant for future IoT scenarios. We contrast our results by performing similar measurements with ZigBee/802.15.4 devices. Our results show that when compared to ZigBee, BLE is indeed very energy efficient in terms of number of bytes transferred per Joule spent. In addition, IPv6 communication energy overhead remains reasonable. We also point out a few specific limitations with current stack implementations and explain that removing those limitations could improve energy utility significantly.

J	Jara, AJ; Zamora, MA; Skarmeta, A				Jara, Antonio J.; Zamora, Miguel A.; Skarmeta, Antonio			Glowbal IP: An adaptive and transparent IPv6 integration in the Internet of Things	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Internet of Things; machine to machine; 6LoWPAN; address management; global communications; end-to-end addressability	SENSOR NETWORK; WEB SERVICES; WIRELESS; DISCOVERY	The Internet of Things (IoT) requires scalability, extensibility and a transparent integration of multi-technology in order to reach an efficient support for global communications, discovery and look-up, as well as access to services and information. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to enable a homogenous and seamless machine-to-machine (M2M) communication mechanism allowing global access to devices, sensors and smart objects. In this respect, the proposed answer to these technological requirements is called Glowbal IF, which is based on a homogeneous access to the devices/sensors offered by the IPv6 addressing and core network. Glowbal IP's main advantages with regard to 6LoWPAN/IPv6 are not only that it presents a low overhead to reach a higher performance on a regular basis, but also that it determines the session and identifies global access by means of a session layer defined over the application layer. Technologies without any native support for IP are thereby adaptable to JP e.g. IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy. This extension towards the IPv6 network opens access to the features and methods of the devices through a homogenous access based on WebServices (e.g. RESTFul/CoAP). In addition to this, Glowbal IP offers global interoperability among the different devices, and interoperability with external servers and users applications. All in all, it allows the storage of information related to the devices in the network through the extension of the Domain Name System (DNS) from the IPv6 core network, by adding the Service Directory extension (DNS-SD) to store information about the sensors, their properties and functionality. A step forward in network-based information systems is thereby reached, allowing a homogenous discovery, and access to the devices from the IoT.

The derived analysis models the generic application of master-to-slave unidirectional data transmission, which also forms an upper bound for bidirectional data transmission throughput. Simulation results show that our model accurately predicts the maximum BLE throughput for all bit error rates and BLE parameter settings evaluated.

The typical approach is to modify the end devices to interpret these signals and to function accordingly [2-5]. But our system proposes an Interpreter System within which these signals are decoded and interfaced with the existing devices. The advantage is that the end devices need not be changed to suit the user, because the logic required for interpretation is within the Interpreter System. Therefore it acts as an interface through which the user can control multiple devices at the same time. Acquisition systems can capture and process EOG, EMG and EEG signals and transmit them to the Interpreter System via the Bluetooth Low Energy module. A communication language using EOG works in combination with EEG and EMG to enable communication. This language will help the users to interface with multiple devices with a limited number of symbols.	[Ramesh, Maneesha V.; Nair, Aswathy Asok; Menon, K. A.

These two factors have increased the rise of chronic diseases and have led to uneven distribution of medical resources as well as the emergence of basic health care demands in emerging markets. Looking forth to the future, it is projected that telecare will become a major means of coping with such issues. According to forecasts by various research institutes, the global telecare market is expected to see an annual 20% growth rate over the coming years. In Gartner's Hype Cycle for Telemedicine, 2010 Report, mobile health monitoring and home health monitoring are listed as highly anticipated health care applications for the future and which will require advanced integration of information and communication technologies. The medical electronics industry has been booming in recent years. With the maturation of wireless LAN (Local Area Network), Bluetooth low energy, and ZigBee technologies, it is projected that medical electronic devices will see further development in wireless connectivity, thereby providing dedicated, stable, and low-cost telecare services for the people. With its strong infrastructure and technological capability, the Taiwanese ICT industry is expected to provide ideal support for the development of telecare. Due to the vigorous involvement of the government and the industry, it is forecasted that the Taiwanese telecare industry will reach approximately US$18 billion in 2015. This speech will analyze the global development trends of telecare and address the applications, opportunities, and future outlook for the biomedical electronics and related industries in Taiwan.

Precise phase locking of the BAW digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to the low-frequency temperature compensated oscillator is demonstrated. Additional cancellation within the ADPLL of the deterministic jitter induced by the bi-frequency mode on the 32 kHz clock is proven, with a residual modulation on the DCO command word corresponding to +/- 0.5 ppm relative frequency deviation. The RF resulting after frequency up-conversion of the system IF signal with the DCO shows an excellent phase noise of -136.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency, for a total synthesizer current consumption of 7.52 mA under 1.6 V supply. In addition, 1 Mb/s GFSK Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy modulations have been successfully validated in transmission.

The use of high-Q microelectromechanical-systems resonators brings interesting benefits to the fundamental building blocks of the frequency synthesis, receiver, and transmitter and allows achieving at the same time low-power consumption, improved phase noise, and high selectivity in the receiver and transmitter paths. In the baseband, the power consumption is minimized thanks to the use of a phase analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which directly quantizes the phase of the received signal instead of using two separate amplitude ADCs. A complete wireless node composed of the transceiver integrated circuit (IC) and a microprocessing IC, both integrated in a standard digital 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology are described and validated by measurement results. The RF carrier phase noise is -136.2 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. The transmitter demonstrates 1-Mb/s Gaussian frequency-shift keying modulation at an output power of 5.4 dBm with an overall current of 35 mA, in compliance with Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy output spectrum requirements. At the receiver, further investigations are needed to find the origins of an unexpected sensitivity of -75 dBm at 200 kb/s.

Both implementation have been designed in a 90 nm CMOS technology for a 1 V supply voltage and post-layout simulation results are presented. The first implementation is a quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) with 180 mu W power consumption and a phase noise of -112.7 dBc/Hz @1MHz. It employs a new technique to reduce the influence of magnetic coupling between the two spiral inductors. The second implementation employs a VCO running at twice the frequency with a subsequent divide-by-2 stage. Its total power consumption is 320 mu W and the phase noise at the quadrature outputs is -115.7 dBc/Hz @1MHz.

However, while wireless technology is far advanced it has yet to be accepted by the medical sector, primarily through concerns of cost, reliability and interoperability. Bluetooth low energy meets all of these requirements and has the added advantage that it will be able to communicate with the Bluetooth chips likely to be fitted to the next generation of mobile phones. That means patient data could be transmitted to a medical facility via the cellular network eliminating the need to build expensive specialised communication links. But while Bluetooth low energy specification promises much, there are some technical challenges - such as protection of privacy - to overcome.
