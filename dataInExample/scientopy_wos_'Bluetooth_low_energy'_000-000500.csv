J	Li, SS				Li, Songsheng			Wildfire early warning system based on wireless sensors and unmanned aerial vehicle	JOURNAL OF UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bluetooth; early warning; forest; sensor; unmanned aerial vehicle; wildfire	FOREST-FIRE DETECTION; DEPLOYMENT	Wildfires erupt annually around the world causing serious loss of life and property damage Despite the rapid progress of science and technology, there are no effective means to forecast wildfires. Various wildfire monitoring systems are deployed in different countries, most depend on photos or videos to identify features of wildfire after the first outbreak, while the delay of confirmation varies with technology. An autonomous forest wildfire early warning system is presented in this paper, which employs a state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly around a forest regularly according to established routes and strict procedures, to collect environmental data from sensors installed on trees, to monitor and predict wildfire, then provide early warning before eruption if a danger emerges. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is employed to exchange data between UAV and the host of sensors. The collected monitoring data, such as temperature and humidity, is effective to reflect the real condition of the forest, which could result in early warning of wildfires. The application of this system in the environment will enhance the ability of wildfire prediction for the community.

J	Liu, YH; Purushothaman, VK; Bachmann, C; Staszewski, RB				Liu, Yao-Hong; Purushothaman, Vijaya Kumar; Bachmann, Christian; Staszewski, Robert Bogdan			Design and Analysis of a DCO-Based Phase-Tracking RF Receiver for IoT Applications	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) receivers; carrier-frequency tracking (CFT); IEEE802154 receivers; low-power transceivers; low-voltage transceivers; phase-tracking receivers; phase-locked loop (PLL)-free receivers		This paper presents an energy-/area-efficient digitally controlled oscillator (DCO)-based phase-tracking Receiver for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The RX leverages the constant-envelope nature of frequency shift keying modulation adopted in many IoT protocols, e.g., IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth low energy (BLE), to enhance the energy efficiency and to reduce the chip area. The proposed RX, with the DCO acting as a local oscillator (LO) and binary frequency feedback, promotes low-power and low-voltage circuit design, while a data-aided carrier-frequency tracking ensures the received carrier stability without a power-/area-hungry phase-locked loop (PLL). The RX avoids a compromise between a power-hungry I/Q LO generation and the image rejection in traditional RXs. An equivalent mathematical model is further presented, which helps to analyze and optimize the frequency response of the proposed RX. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the RX consumes 1.55 mW from a 0.85-V supply and has a -87-dBm sensitivity at 2 Mb/s, which leads to a 0.77-nJ/b energy efficiency and 178-dB RX sensitivity FoM.

J	Jondhale, SR; Deshpande, RS				Jondhale, Satish R.; Deshpande, Rajkumar S.			GRNN and KF framework based real time target tracking using PSOC BLE and smartphone	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						General Regression Neural Network (GRNN); Target tracking; PSOC BLE nodes		With the advancements in the mobile devices having Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability, the BLE based indoor target localization is the recent trend. The majority of indoor localization methods generally rely on traditional simple techniques such as trilateration or angulation. However significant localization errors are involved with these techniques due to highly nonlinear relationship between RSSI and distance because of issues such as NLOS, multipath propagation. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) with a one pass learning capability, is well known for its ability to train quickly. This paper proposes an application of GRNN as an alternative to these traditional techniques to obtain first location estimates of moving person using a hybrid network of PSOC BLE nodes and smartphone, which are further refined using Kalman filtering (KF) framework. Two algorithms namely, GRNN + Kalman filter and GRNN + Unscented Kalman filter are proposed in this research work. The GRNN is trained with the RSSI values from PSOC BLE nodes at various locations and the corresponding actual 2-D locations of the given monitoring area. The real time experiments prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the traditional approach in the context of NLOS, multipath propagation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, LB; Jin, XX; Zhou, M; Wang, Y; Tian, ZS				Xie, Liangbo; Jin, Xiaoxiao; Zhou, Mu; Wang, Yue; Tian, Zengshan			Cost-efficient BLE fingerprint database construction approach via multi-quadric RBF interpolation	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; Indoor localization; Location fingerprint database; Radial basis function; MEMS	INDOOR; NETWORKS; LOCALIZATION; SPECTRUM	The demand for indoor localization is becoming urgent, but the traditional location fingerprint approach takes a lot of manpower and time to construct a fine-grained location fingerprint database. To address this problem, we propose to use the approach of combining dynamic collection of fingerprint samples with Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation. Specifically, the raw sparse fingerprint database is constructed from a small number of fingerprints collected on a few paths, in which the pedestrian track correction algorithm improves the validity and accuracy of the sparse fingerprint database. Then, the RBF interpolation approach is applied to enrich the sparse fingerprint database, in which the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the free shape parameter and the cut-off radius is determined according to the experimental results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach guarantees high interpolation and localization accuracy and also significantly reduces the effort of manual collection of fingerprint samples.

J	Wang, W; He, SY; Sun, L; Jiang, T; Zhang, Q				Wang, Wei; He, Shiyue; Sun, Liang; Jiang, Tao; Zhang, Qian			Cross-Technology Communications for Heterogeneous IoT Devices Through Artificial Doppler Shifts	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Cross-technology communication; wireless; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth; Internet of Things (IoT)	NETWORKS	Recent years have seen major innovations in developing energy-efficient wireless technologies, such as the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) for Internet of Things (IoT). Despite demonstrating significant benefits in providing low power transmission and massive connectivity, very few of these technologies directly connect to the Internet. Recent advances demonstrate the viability of direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices with incompatible physical layers. These techniques, however, require modifications in transmission power or time, which may affect the media access control layer behaviors in legacy networks. In this paper, we argue that the frequency domain can serve as a free side channel with minimal interruptions to legacy networks. To this end, we propose DopplerFi, a communication framework that enables a two-way communication channel between BLE and Wi-Fi by injecting artificial Doppler shifts, which can be decoded by sensing the patterns in the Gaussian frequency shift keying demodulator and channel state information. The artificial Doppler shifts can be compensated for by the inherent frequency synchronization module and thus have a negligible impact on legacy communications. Our evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf BLE chips and 802.11-compliant testbeds has demonstrated that DopplerFi can achieve a throughput of up to 6.5 Kb/s at the cost of merely less than 0.8% throughput loss.

The SHiB is a low cost and easily deployable kit designed to collect data from a wrist-worn wearable in a home environment. The data presented is intended to evaluate room level indoor localization methods. The wearable device registers tri-axial accelerometer measurements which are sampled and transmitted as the payload of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet. Four receiving gateways, each placed in a different room throughout a typical residential house, extract the accelerometer data and determine a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for each received BLE packet. RSSI values can represent propagation losses due to distance or shadowing between the wearable transmitter and the gateway receiver. The dataset is presented in two parts. The first is composed of four calibration or training sequences, carried out by ten participants to offer ground truth calibrations for four rooms in the house. We refer to the calibration phase as the steps taken to gather training data. The calibration procedure was designed to be as straight-forward as possible, to allow a participant to adequately train the SHiB system without supervision. Ten participants each carried out a straight forward calibration procedure once, with four participants carrying out the calibration twice, on different occasions. One participant carried out the calibration on a third occasion. The second part of the data consists of a free-living experiment that was carried out over a period of five and a half hours starting at 7.37 a.m. Of this, one and a half hours of measurements are recorded within a room containing a gateway, where one participant carried out activities of daily living while their ground-truth location was accurately annotated within each room with a gateway present. The calibration data can be used as a training scheme and the living data as a test scenario.

Respiratory monitoring system using Bluetooth Low Energy	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						Beacon; Breath monitoring; IoT; Micropower; Mobile system; Smart sensor	SENSOR SYSTEM; PRESSURE	The paper presents a system for monitoring respiratory frequency and strength using a BLE transmitter in non-connectable advertising mode and a variable impedance sensor operating in a relaxation oscillator circuit. The presented solution is characterized by low energy consumption. Both the measurement system and teletransmission system operate at 2.2 V power supply. By using a micropower operational amplifier, the analogue part of the system consumes 240-300 mu W. Unipolar power supply and configuration of the relaxation oscillator enable to create a pseudobinary signal with the frequency f < 10 kHz. The relaxation oscillator is connected to the microcontroller binary input without having to convert the signal. By using a System On Chip (SoC) with CPU ARM Cortex to control the radio and perform measurements of the pseudobinary signal, the design was simplified and its dimensions were reduced. The operation of the analogue part of the system was compared with a commercial sensor. In addition, the ability of the system to reproduce the breath cycle signal on the BLE side was verified.

J	Baek, SH; Cha, SH				Baek, Seung Hyo; Cha, Seung Hyun			The trilateration-based BLE Beacon system for analyzing user-identified space usage of New Ways of Working offices	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						New ways of working; Space usage analysis; Space planning; Activity-based working; BLE Beacon; Localization technique	BEHAVIOR PATTERN DETECTION; OCCUPANCY DETECTION; BUILDING ENERGY; WI-FI; TIME; MODEL; SIMULATION; SATISFACTION; FLEXIBILITY; MANAGEMENT	For successful implementation of the New Ways of Working (NWW) office, it is necessary to plan on the basis of user-identified space usage information. Of the different methods, a trilateration-based Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) Beacon system has a greater potential as it provides specific location information. However, the feasibility of implementing a trilateration-based BLE Beacon system has not yet been validated in space-usage analysis in the NWW office. The present study thus aimed to establish whether such a system would be suitable for the purpose. Two sets of experiments were performed in an open-plan office in order to evaluate system accuracy. The present study used two indexes: Distance Difference (DD) and Accuracy Rate of User-Identified Location Estimation (AR). The best average DD was 0.7 m at desk 5 in the first experiment, which is promising. However, the overall experimental DDs were 1.63 m and 1.93 m, while both DD and AR showed significant variance between desks. These findings indicate that system accuracy and consistency are not yet sufficient for space usage analysis in the NWW office. Accordingly, to enhance system accuracy and consistency it will be essential to develop strategies for optimal system deployment and to combine them with other methods.

A compact low-power wireless system for in vivo evaluation of heat and moisture exchanger performance	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						temperature monitoring; humidity monitoring; low-power system; in vivo monitoring; artificial ventilation; critical care	LARYNGECTOMIZED INDIVIDUALS; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; TRACHEAL TEMPERATURE; HUMIDITY SENSORS; EX-VIVO; EFFICIENCY; HUMIDIFICATION; SEDATION; DELIRIUM; AEROSOL	Reliable tools for monitoring heat and moisture exchanger (HME) performance are in high demand by physicians, in order to assess the proper air conditioning delivered to intensive care unit (ICU) patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. To date, there is no system that comprehends all the requirements for clinical applications, in terms of performance and design. In this paper, a compact measurement system is proposed for monitoring HME performance in vivo, comparing the results with in vitro testing outcomes. The portable system presented is connected to the ventilation circuit close to the HME and assures wide compatibility with the new generation of smart devices because of its embedded Bluetooth low-energy module. Low power consumption ensures long-term monitoring capability of more than 24h. Laboratory tests performed both in static and dynamic conditions showed rise- and fall-times for humidity measurements between 1s and 1.8 s, compatible with many common variations in working operative conditions during mechanical ventilation. Clinical tests performed in the ICU demonstrated the possibility to effectively and continuously monitor in vivo HME performance. Furthermore, the comparison of the in vivo performances with the in vitro standard procedure and the agreement of the parameter ranges monitored allowed us to confirm the reliability of the system, highlighting the usefulness of this approach for proper real time HME monitoring.

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) works with the minimum amount of power and data rate, sufficient to handle the IoT applications. Wi-Fi Alliance also developed the IEEE 802.11ah which is specifically designed for IoT applications. In this paper, we performed heterogeneous wireless network scenario between the advanced IEEE 802.15.1 (BLE) and IEEE 802.11ah (HaLow) based on Receive Signal Strength as threshold parameter for vertical handover. The simulation results show the Bluetooth versions of Basic Rate, BLE, and Wi-Fi (HaLow) network with the data rate increment after the handover.

J	Huang, K; He, K; Du, XC				Huang, Ke; He, Ke; Du, Xuecheng			A Hybrid Method to Improve the BLE-Based Indoor Positioning in a Dense Bluetooth Environment	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor positioning; Bluetooth Low Energy; dense Bluetooth environment; trilateration; dead reckoning; Kalman filter		Indoor positioning using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons has attracted considerable attention after the release of the BLE protocol. A number of efforts have been exerted to improve the performance of BLE-based indoor positioning. However, few studies pay attention to the BLE-based indoor positioning in a dense Bluetooth environment, where the propagation of BLE signals become more complex and more fluctuant. In this paper, we draw attention to the problems resulting from the dense Bluetooth environment, and it turns out that the dense Bluetooth environment would result in a high received signal strength indication (RSSI) variation and a longtime interval collection of BLE. Hence, to mitigate the effects of the dense Bluetooth environment, we propose a hybrid method fusing sliding-window filtering, trilateration, dead reckoning and the Kalman filtering method to improve the performance of the BLE indoor positioning. The Kalman filter is exploited to merge the trilateration and dead reckoning. Extensive experiments in a real implementation are conducted to examine the performance of three approaches: trilateration, dead reckoning and the fusion method. The implementation results proved that the fusion method was the most effective method to improve the positioning accuracy and timeliness in a dense Bluetooth environment. The positioning root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculation results have showed that the hybrid method can achieve a real-time positioning and reduce error of indoor positioning.

Using the received signal strength (RSS) of a BLE signal and the uniqueness of BLE hardware addresses, mobile subjects can be identified and localized within the hospital room. The RSS measurement of the BLE signal from a wearable BLE beacon varies with distance to the wall-anchored BLE scanner. In order to understand and demonstrate the practicality of the relationship between RSS of a BLE beacon and the distance of a beacon from a scanner, the first part of the paper presents the analysis of the experiments conducted in a low-noise and nonreflective environment. Based on the analysis conducted in an ideal environment, the second half of the paper proposes a data-driven localization process for pinpointing the movements of the subject within the experimental room. In order to ensure higher accuracy like fingerprinting techniques and handle the increased number of BLE-anchored scanners like geometric techniques, the proposed algorithm was designed to combine the best aspects of these two techniques for better localization. The paper evaluates the effects of the number of BLE wall-mounted scanners and the number of packets on the performance of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm locates the patient within the room with error less than 1.8m. It also performs better than other classical approaches used in localization.

MAC Layer Protocols for Internet of Things: A Survey	FUTURE INTERNET			English	Review						Internet of Things; Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN); Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs); short range protocols; long range protocols; medium access control; MAC layer protocols; layer two protocols	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; IEEE 802.11AH; CHALLENGES; MACHINE; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; STANDARDS; IOT	Due to the wide variety of uses and the diversity of features required to meet an application, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are moving forward at a strong pace to meet this demand while at the same time trying to meet the time-to-market of these applications. The characteristics required by applications, such as coverage area, scalability, transmission data rate, and applicability, refer to the Physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer designs of protocols. This paper presents a deep study of medium access control (MAC) layer protocols that are used in IoT with a detailed description of such protocols grouped (by short and long distance coverage). For short range coverage protocols, the following are considered: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, Wireless Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol (Wireless-HART), Z-Wave, Weightless, and IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ah. For the long range group, Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT), Long Term Evolution (LTE) CAT-0, LTE CAT-M, LTE CAT-N, Long Range Protocol (LoRa), and SigFox protocols are studied. A comparative study is performed for each group of protocols in order to provide insights and a reference study for IoT applications, considering their characteristics, limitations, and behavior. Open research issues on the topic are also identified.	[Oliveira, Luiz; Rodrigues, Joel J. P. C.] Natl Inst Telecommun Inatel, BR-37540000 Santa Rita Do Sapucai, MG, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Joel J. P.

Nowadays, traffic control at intersections is typically done by traffic light systems which are not optimal and exhibit several drawbacks, such as poor efficiency and real-time adaptability. With the advent of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicles are being equipped with state-of-the-art technology, enabling cooperative decision-making which will certainly overwhelm the available traffic control systems. This solution strongly penalizes users without such capabilities, namely pedestrians, cyclists, and other legacy vehicles. Therefore, in this work, a prototype based on an alternative technology to the standard vehicular communications, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), is presented. The proposed framework aims to integrate legacy and modern vehicular communication systems into a cohesive management system. In this framework, the movements of users at intersections are managed by a centralized controller which, through the use of networked retransmitters deployed at intersections, broadcasts alerts and virtual light signalization orders. Users receive the aforementioned information on their own smart devices, discarding the need for dedicated light signalization infrastructures. Field tests, carried out with a real-world implementation, validate the correct operation of the proposed framework.

J	Yang, ZR; Ganz, A				Yang, Zhuorui; Ganz, Aura			A Sensing Framework for Indoor Spatial Awareness for Blind and Visually Impaired Uses	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Indoor localization; bluetooth low energy; sensing framework; spatial cognition; cognitive neuroscience; visually impaired	HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; NAVIGATION SYSTEM; INFORMATION; RATS	In this paper, we present Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based sensing framework that provides real time spatial awareness for blind and visually impaired (BVI) users while navigating independently through large public venues. The proposed framework includes the following functionalities using only the received signal strength indicator obtained from the BLE sensors: 1) determining the location of the user, 2) estimating the user's moving direction, and 3) detecting the proximity of landmarks next to the user. We evaluate these functionalities individually. Moreover, we incorporate the proposed framework in PERCEPT indoor navigation system and test it with BVI users in a large public venue. Testing results show that the location, moving direction, and landmark proximity computed by the framework, although not very accurate, provide sufficient information to enable BVI users to independently navigate in large indoor venues. This conclusion aligns with Nobel Prize winning findings that confirm the spatial nature of the entorhinal-hippocampal system and the existence of a positioning system in the brain.

This solution includes software and sensor hardware installed at each parking space. Because the smartphone is prevalent nowadays, we also design a smartphone application to enable users to easily access information regarding parking spaces near the user's destination and devise the best path to it anytime, anywhere. We choose Apple iOS as the programming platform on the smartphone and Raspberry Pi 3 as the sensor hardware, which uses an infrared distance sensor to determine whether the parking space has been occupied by a vehicle or not. We also adopt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to connect sensors of all roadside parking lots and build a BLE mesh sensor network to collect parking statuses. A routing protocol for the BLE mesh sensor network to efficiently forward parking information to the parking management server is proposed in this paper. Finally, we present the software and sensor hardware used for implementing this parking management system, the simulator to execute the proposed BLE mesh routing algorithm, and snapshots of the parking app.	[Chang, Ing-Chau; Hsu, Peng-Jun; Lin, Yuan-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Sheng; Chen, Pin-Lin; Lin, Xian-Feng] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 2 Shida Rd, Changhua 500, Taiwan; [Yen, Chin-En] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, 168 Jifeng E Rd, Taichung 41349, Taiwan	Yen, CE (reprint author), Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, 168 Jifeng E Rd, Taichung 41349, Taiwan.	icchang@cc.ncue.edu.tw; hsu.pengjun@icloud.com; sam19950810@gmail.com; mouoreo@gmail.com; bulss8516@gmail.com; kevenlove1029@gmail.com; ceyen@cyut.edu.tw			Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 106-2221-E-018-008-]	This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, under Grant Number MOST 106-2221-E-018-008-.

Although many candidate technologies have been proposed, no one can still adapt to every use case. A case centered design and the implementation of the solution within the specific domain is the current research trend. With the rise of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons, i.e., platforms used to interact digitally with the real world, more standard positioning solutions are emerging in different contexts. However the reachable positioning accuracy with this technology is still unacceptable for some real applications (e.g., in the healthcare sector or the emergency management). In this paper, an hybrid localization application coupling a real time model based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) technique and the analysis of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of BLE beacons is proposed. In particular, the smartphone application is composed by three main real time threads: a model based step length estimation, heading determination and the fusion of beacon information to reset the position and the drift error of the PDR. In order to give soundness to our approach we firstly validated the step length smartphone app with a stereo-photogrammetric system. The whole proposed solution was then tested on fifteen healthy subjects.

Wireless fingerprinting based on BLE beacons has emerged as an increasingly popular solution for fine-grained indoor localization. Inspired by the idea of mobility tracking used in the cellular network, this paper proposes a BLE-based tracking system, designated as BTrack, to learn the location area (LA) of an indoor user based on the reported wireless fingerprinting combined with statistical analysis. We propose a new particle Markov chain model to evaluate the LA-level performance regarding the visibility area in an environment with large obstacles. In the presence of sight obstructions, BTrack is evaluated using a real-world test bed built in a library with tall bookshelves. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the mean distance error and the LA prediction accuracy considering the direct line-of-sight. Compared with the existing methods, BTrack reduces the average localization error by 25% and improves the average prediction accuracy by more than 16% given a random mobility pattern.

Multiple antenna design approaches for tuning on-body antennas have been investigated. The proposed antennas patch and meandered, designed for operation in the insole, exhibit a simulated realized gain of -3.98 and -1.97 dB, respectively. The antennas were fabricated on a 25 mu m flexible polyimide substrate, exhibiting up to 16% lower insertion losses at 20 GHz than FR4 PCBs. The integrated node incorporates a commercial Bluetooth low energy system-on-chip and exhibits 9 dB higher measured gain than commercial modules with reference antenna design. Moreover, through functional radio test, it was confirmed that the designed node passes Bluetooth transmitter certification tests.

The design exploits particular aspects of BLE, such as the relaxed in-band interference characteristics, more precisely the C/I-1 MHz, and the relatively high-frequency-shift keying modulation index, to deliver a high level of energy efficiency and simplicity to the receiver baseband architecture. Reliable quadrature signals are generated in the RF signal path without consuming energy, which is supported by an inverter-based low-noise amplifier (LNA) that achieves high gain and low noise figure under low-power budgets. A small-signal analysis of low-power inverter-based LNAs is presented offering simple design equations. Seeking an affordable solution, the fabricated prototype is fully integrated into an earlier generation CMOS technology node (0.13 mu m), occupying a silicon area smaller than 0.7 mm(2). The receiver achieves a sensitivity level of -92 dBm while consuming 1.41 mA from a 1.2-V supply.

Moreover, long sensing times, complexity, and inability to track concurrent interference strongly inhibit their applicability in most IoT deployments. Motivated by the increasing need for on-device IDI for wireless coexistence, we develop a lightweight and efficient method targeting interference identification already at the level of single interference bursts. Our method exploits real-time extraction of envelope and model-aided spectral features, specifically designed considering the physical properties of the signals captured with COTS hardware. We adopt manifold supervised-learning (SL) classifiers ensuring suitable performance and complexity tradeoff for the IoT platforms with different computational capabilities. The proposed IDI method is capable of real-time identification of IEEE 802.11b/g/n, 802.15.4, 802.15.1, and Bluetooth Low Energy wireless standards, enabling isolation and extraction of standard-specific traffic statistics even in the case of heavy concurrent interference. We perform an experimental study in real environments with heterogeneous interference scenarios, showing 90%-97% burst identification accuracy. Meanwhile, the lightweight SL methods, running online on wireless sensor networks-COTS hardware, ensure sub-ms identification time and limited performance gap from machine-learning approaches.

By different reasons the localization of mobile devices in closed areas has not yet fully developed because of missing of a reliable positioning technology. The paper presents a hybrid method for improving the accuracy of indoor positioning approach for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mobile devices based on optimized combination of Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Receive Signal Strength (RSS) technologies. We propose a hybrid optimization method for indoor positioning, realized by two stage data fusion process using Extended Kalman filtering approach and Fraser-Potter equation. The test results show that the proposed method can achieve sensitively better accuracy in a real environment compared to existing indoor localization methods and techniques.

Among a wide set of standard wireless technologies already available on the market, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is becoming one of the most widespread and exploited. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology for analyzing and characterizing throughput performance in general sensor network applications. In particular, we want to assess the effective BLE performance in order to investigate its possible usage in applications that require high throughput, such as body area network (BAN) for motion tracking of human movements, using magneto-inertial sensor units (M-IMUs). In addition to this, we have also studied how different nodes, with different hardware, software, and firmware, can affect the network performance. The results of this paper show how different typologies of nodes can be better exploited dependently on the specific application they are involved in. In fact, we define how to set up BLE parameters in order to push this technology to its limit. Finally, we address the specific case of using BLE as the wireless infrastructure of a BAN for human motion tracking: in this scenario, we show that BLE can be employed to successfully transmit M-IMU data from 5 peripheral nodes with a sampling frequency higher than 200 Hz.

However, most of existing positioning technologies have high errors or require some extra special hardware. This study proposes an algorithm to change the environmental attenuation factor and compensation mechanism according to the current situation of the environment, and reduce the signal anomaly caused by the decrease of positioning accuracy. To ensure the positioning system has a certain positioning accuracy to achieve system efficiency, the method consists of three stages: First of all, calculate the current environmental attenuation factor by distance. Secondly, compensate the lack of signal distance according to the compensation mechanism. Finally, the triangulation method and the revised signal are used to locate. The experimental results show that the average positioning error of the proposed method is less than 0.5 m, which is better than some of the existing positioning methods, and provides accuracy and practicality to the positioning system.

In this context, the share of the equipment is fundamental to reduce expedition but may cause an excessive loss of time by medical staff that needs devices for the clinical therapy. Therefore, knowing localization is useful for health monitoring of important electromedical devices. In recent years, a lot of technologies have been developed for the indoor localization, like the Bluetooth wireless standard technology. In particular, Beacon technology is very interesting, which uses the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology. However, due to the complexity of internal ambiences, the development of an indoor localization method is always associated with various problems, mainly for the presence of obstacles among the direction of propagation of signals. Application of BLE for the localization of medical equipment could help to save time during an emergency. With this preliminary study, using Beacon devices like tag, three mathematical average methods for reducing variability in indoor localization techniques are performed. Although mathematic average methods can reduce variability, it is very difficult to eliminate the calculation error of the tag-reader distance. Nevertheless, in this preliminary analysis the mathematical method using the average of RSSI measures present a constant error pattern, along distances, ranged between 0 and 8 m not too big for a room localization method.

Our method is based on local estimation, through statistical filtering of RSSI measurements (Extended Kalman Filter), of the proximity between the beacons that delimit the different areas and the one in the lifeline, followed by a finite state machine risk status detector. Experiments have been performed in a real construction work-place with a wearable device; their results show that our solution is ideal for dynamic construction environments. Its main advantages are robustness of the detection system, easy relocation of the beacons as the construction zone evolves, and no need for calibration, communication infrastructure, external processing support, or configuration/map updates.

With existing infrastructures, wireless positioning is widely used to provide the location service. However, wireless positioning has the limitations such as highly depending on the distribution of access points (APs); providing a low sample-rate and noisy solution; requiring extensive labor costs to build databases; and having unstable RSS values in indoor environments. To reduce these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative integrated platform for indoor localization by integrating low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and wireless signals. This proposed platform consists of wireless AP localization engine and sensor fusion engine, which is suitable for both dense and sparse deployments of wireless APs. The proposed platform can automatically generate wireless databases for positioning, and provide a positioning solution even in the area with only one observed wireless AP, where the traditional trilateration method cannot work. This integration platform can integrate different kinds of wireless APs together for indoor localization (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth low energy, and radio frequency identification). The platform fuses all of these wireless distances with low-cost MEMS sensors to provide a robust localization solution. A multilevel quality control mechanism is utilized to remove noisy RSS measurements from wireless APs and to further improve the localization accuracy. Preliminary experiments show the proposed integration platform can achieve the average accuracy of 3.30 m with the sparse deployment of wireless APs (1 AP per 800 m(2)).

Under this light, positioning services that harvest location fingerprinting based on received signal strength indications (RSSIs) are widely popular due to the massive data generation that IoT settings provide. However, the labor-intensive and repetitive task of the radio map construction through offline RSSI fingerprint collection prevents such services from becoming standard equipment for future smart facilities. In this paper, we present a location-aware infrastructure that combines a broad sensing layer, edge computing, and centralized cloud federation support. Our setting gives rise to a sensing mechanism that enables in-facility crowdsourcing able to aid fingerprinting localization services. To that end, instead of extensive offline measurements, we use the facility occupants to gather unlabeled RSSI samples. To support the localization functionality, we develop a probabilistic cell-based model that is constructed by an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our black-box approach maintains the positioning accuracy regardless of changes in the underlying hardware or indoor environment. To evaluate our approach, we have deployed a multistorey facility testbed and performed an extensive real-subject trial to gather the unlabeled fingerprint dataset. The proposed unsupervised method yields average location classification accuracy of 0.8 that can rise up to 0.9 when a semi-supervised approach is considered. We also provide insights into the performance of the proposed infrastructure regarding mobility tracking, and under varying deployment scenarios.

BLEDoorGuard: A Device-Free Person Identification Framework Using Bluetooth Signals for Door Access	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Access control; activity recognition; Bluetooth; device-free	FREE LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Recently, door access control with Internet of Things has become increasingly popular in the field of security. However, conventional approaches such as video-based or biological information-based cannot satisfy the requirements of personal privacy protection in the modern society. Hence, a wireless signal-based technique which does not need users to carry any devices, called device-free have been introduced in recent years to detect and identify persons. In this paper, we present BLEDoorGuard, a wireless, invisible, and robust door access system which leverages received signal strength indicator from Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons to recognize a person who accesses a door. We evaluated BLEDoorGuard in two real-world scenarios: the first is an office with a key lock, and the second is a meeting room with swipe card access. We exploit the characteristics of use of BLE for person identification and propose a two-step algorithm with multiple classifiers. We demonstrate that BLEDoorGuard is capable of identifying the actual user during door access with an accuracy of 69% and 62% among groups of 6 and 10 people, respectively.

Pattern-of-Life Modeling in Smart Homes	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Cyber-physical systems; security and privacy; smart environment; test-bed and trials		Smart home devices are relatively inexpensive, readily available, and easily integrated into homes. However, retailers provide smart home devices with little scrutiny in regards to device security or known vulnerabilities. This paper presents a smart home architecture designed with commercially available devices used to investigate Internet of Things data leakage in the wild. Additionally, a pattern-of-life analysis tool was developed to exhibit how an eavesdropper can use traffic from a smart home to classify devices, identify events, track users, and gain physical access to a home. The tool was evaluated through five-days of experimentation in which 17 of 18 devices were classified, 95% of 343 events were identified, and users were tracked with near 100% accuracy. This information, combined with a discovered Bluetooth low energy lock vulnerability, were used to gain unfettered access to the home while the user was away. Furthermore, a mitigation technique was created to introduce spoofed wireless traffic sent on behalf of devices within the home to hinder an eavesdropper's ability to classify devices, identify events, and track users. During an additional five-day experiment, security devices were concealed, 221 false events were introduced per day, and the user appeared always home. Finally, this paper provides security recommendations to manufacturers and users to help defend against vulnerabilities and create a safer smart home environment.

However, such sensors may not be stable, resulting in high detection error rates. Thus, how to improve indoor positioning accuracy has become an important topic. This study explored Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon indoor positioning for smart home power management. A novel system framework using BLE Beacon was proposed to detect the user location, and to perform power management in the home through a mobile device application. Since the BLE Beacon may produce a multipath effect, this study used the positioning algorithm and hardware configuration to reduce the error rate. Location fingerprint positioning algorithm and filter modification were used to establish a positioning method for facilitating deployment, and to reduce the required computing resources. The experiments included an observation of the Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) and selecting filters and a discussion of the relationship between the characteristics of the BLE Beacon signal accuracy and the number of the BLE Beacons deployed in the observation space. The BLE Beacon multilateration positioning was combined with the In-Snergy intelligent energy management system for smart home power management. The contribution of this study is to allow users to enjoy smart home services based on their location within the home using a mobile device application.

IoT involves smart devices that can be connected to the cloud in order to share and process all types of data collected through sensors. Moreover, 100% of smartphones and tablets shipped in 2018 include Bluetooth low energy, which will allow the interoperation with the upcoming 5G standard. As a result, different low-power hardware platforms have become available to either build prototypes, or implement full IoT solutions. One fundamental aspect while choosing a development platform is to analyze the power consumption of its components to build an optimal low-power application and extend the battery life.

Although several competitions provide datasets and environments for comparing different solutions, they hardly consider novel technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is gaining more and more importance in indoor localization due to its wide availability in personal and environmental devices and to its low costs and flexibility. This paper contributes to cover this gap by: (i) presenting a new indoor BLE dataset; (ii) reviewing several, meaningful use cases in different application scenarios; and (iii) discussing alternative uses of the dataset in the evaluation of different positioning and navigation applications, namely localization, tracking, occupancy and social interaction.

This is an interactive process with visualisation information that can help user's orientation inside unknown buildings and the data stored from different users can provide useful information about users' movements inside a public building. Beacons installed on the building at specific pre-defined positions emit signals that give a geographic position with an associated imprecision, related with Bluetooth's range. This uncertainty is handled by building layout and users' movement in a developed system that maps users' position, gives guidance, and stores user movements. This system is based on an App (Find Me!) for Android OS (Operating System) which captures the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal coming from the beacon(s) and shows, through a map, the location of the user's smartphone and guide him to the desired destination. Also, the beacons can deliver relevant context information. The application was tested by a panel of new and habitual campus users against traditional wayfinding alternatives yielding navigation times about 30% smaller, respectively.

J	Subedi, S; Pyun, JY				Subedi, Santosh; Pyun, Jae-Young			Lightweight Workload Fingerprinting Localization Using Affinity Propagation Clustering and Gaussian Process Regression	SENSORS			English	Article						affinity propagation clustering; bluetooth low energy; fingerprinting localization; gaussian process regression	INDOOR; ALGORITHM	Fingerprinting localization approach is widely used in indoor positioning applications owing to its high reliability. However, the learning procedure of radio signals in fingerprinting is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, an affinity propagation clustering (APC)-based fingerprinting localization system with Gaussian process regression (GPR) is presented for a practical positioning system with the reduced offline workload and low online computation cost. The proposed system collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) data from the deployed Bluetooth low energy beacons and trains them with the Gaussian process model. As the signal estimation component, GPR predicts not only the mean RSS but also the variance, which indicates the uncertainty of the estimation. The predicted RSS and variance can be employed for probabilistic-based fingerprinting localization. As the clustering component, the APC minimizes the searching space of reference points on the testbed. Consequently, it also helps to reduce the localization estimation error and the computational cost of the positioning system. The proposed method is evaluated through real field deployments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the offline workload and increase localization accuracy with less computational cost. This method outperforms the existing methods owing to RSS prediction using GPR and RSS clustering using APC.

In this study, a new sensor node design, which includes ambient light and temperature sensors employing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol, is used as an IoT application. Subsequent to this, sensor node power consumption and management cost was investigated. The experimental results show that the developed sensor node lifetime is about 8 years and the total cost of nodes and gateway model is under $50 per year per 0.1 hectare.

The proposed 10-b ultralow-power isolated constant-slope digital-to-time converter (DTC) achieves a 580-fs resolution and a measured integral nonlinearity (INL) of 870 fs with 0.14-mW power consumption at 52 MS/s. A narrow-range time amplifier (TA)-time-to-digital converter (TDC) with gain calibration minimizes both the in-band phase noise degradation and the loop-bandwidth variation. In addition, a coarse-DPLL is introduced with dead-zone function, which reduces the phase lock time to 4.2 mu s at a 13-MHz frequency error. The coarse-DPLL monitors large frequency and phase jump in the background while consuming almost zero power. In an ultralow power mode, the proposed fractional-N ADPLL consumes a 0.65-mW power with a 26-MHz reference. A rms jitter of 1.00 ps and -50-dBc in-band fractional spur are achieved with a -242-dB FOM. In high-performance mode, a reference doubler is utilized, the jitter and spurs can be improved to 535 fs and -56 dBc, respectively, while consuming 0.98 mW. The proposed ADPLL with scalable power and jitter performance can be utilized for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi networks.

Specifically, we propose to replace the conventional channel settling with a band settling that would be carried out only once per global device power up. The ADPLL locks to the center of the Bluetooth band (2440 MHz) upon system powerup and jointly performs an instantaneous channel hopping and Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation in a twopoint manner to overcome the narrow PLL bandwidth (BW) due to the 32.768-kHz reference. Extensive calibrations linearize the effective cubic digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) transfer function to achieve a precise frequency range of hopping and modulation. Realized in 16-nm FinFET, it consumes <1 mW at <= 0.45 V, while achieving best-in-class performance and <100-ns hopping time.

The proposed TRX utilizes a wide-bandwidth low-power fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) as a central component to perform multiple roles: a direct frequency modulator for the transmitter (TX), an analogto-digital converter (ADC) for the receiver (RX), a local oscillator for RX, and a frequency and phase synchronizer for the RX. The DPLL-based single-path downconversion method is adapted to halve the analog baseband circuit to further reduce the power consumption while maintaining a high interference rejection. A DPLL-based ADC with a digital-to-analog converter feedback greatly improves the ADC dynamic range, which improves the RX sensitivity and interference tolerance. By maximally reducing the required radio frequency and analog front-end components in RX, an RX power consumption of 2.3 mW is achieved with a -94 dBm sensitivity. The RX also satisfied all interference requirements with a certain margin. A 5.0-mW TX is achieved when delivering an output power of 0 dBm with a frequency-shift keying error of only 1.89%.

SDN-Based Multi-Protocol Edge Switching for IoT Service Automation	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Protocol independent; SDN; IoT; BLE; Zigbee; P4		This paper proposes Muppet, an edge-based multi-protocol architecture for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployment and service automation. The crux of Muppet is a P4-based switch that inserts itself in between communicating IoT devices that can use different protocols. The switches are networked over IP to support wide area deployment and managed using centralized SDN control for scalability. Muppet provides many of the benefits of both native peer-to-peer and widely used cloud-centric approaches while avoiding their drawbacks. For example, Muppet offers low-latency and low-energy benefits of the peer-to-peer approach, while enabling wide-area, cross-protocol automation similar to the cloud-based solutions. We describe the P4 design and prototype realization of the switch using two very popular, but widely disparate, IoT protocols, namely, Bluetooth low energy and Zigbee. Through experiments, we show that Muppet is as efficient as peer-to-peer in terms of delay and energy usage, and scalable and programmable as cloud-based solutions. We illustrate its utility through practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

This research developed an ear-attached acceleration sensor of low power consumption for sow welfare studies. The sensor weighed only 10.0 g and was composed of a 3-axis accelerometer, a Bluetooth Low Energy module, a printed circuit board antenna, and a 3-V, 230-mAh CR2032 battery. It entered into a sleeping state when no activities of the monitored sow were detected, to conserve battery energy. In the sleeping state, the sensor still read data from the accelerometer at 1 Hz, but did not transfer data wirelessly to a receiver if a first-order difference that differentiated sow resting from its other activities was below a defined threshold. Laboratory and 8-sow field tests were conducted to assess the sensor performance in three operational modes (continuous, data grouping, and power saving). Results showed that there were three major behaviours of the sows (resting, moving, and eating) and the behaviour patterns differed from sow to sow. The ear-attached sensors could in principle be used to monitor and predict sow farrowing while not causing sow abnormal behaviours. In the continuous mode, data broadcasting consumed 97.6% energy and the battery life was only about 31 days. The average battery life could be extended to about 288 days in power saving mode when the first-order difference threshold was set at 0.1 g. Compared with reported similar acceleration sensors, this new sensor provided more than double the battery life while reducing the sensor mass by more than 70%. (C) 2018 IAgrE.

This paper presents an experimental investigation of the indoor positioning algorithms based on the signal strength received from the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We have implemented and compared several positioning algorithms (Proximity Localization, Centroid Localization, Weighted Centroid Localization, Weight-Compensated Weighted Centroid Localization Based on RSSI, Fingerprinting and Trilateration Localization). We also proposed and implemented a fuzzy logic based scheme to select the most fitting algorithm depending upon the size of the room, the number of beacons available and the strength of the signal. We have evaluated our scheme in real-world conditions (office building). The experimental results show that the algorithm of fingerprinting localization is the most suitable one. Finally, we propose a fuzzy logic system for the selection of an indoor localization algorithm based on the size of the room, the number of available beacons, and the strength of RSSI signal.

J	Park, JK; Kim, J; Kang, SJ				Park, Jung Kwang; Kim, Jeeyoung; Kang, Soon Ju			A Situation-Aware Indoor Localization (SAIL) System Using a LF and RF Hybrid Approach	SENSORS			English	Article						WSN; indoor-localization; situation-aware; low-frequency; BLE; RSSI; trajectory tracking; mobile asset management; IoT	RECEIVED SIGNAL STRENGTH	Recently, studies focusing on identifying user's current location for use in a wide variety of differentiated location-based and localization services have steadily increased. In particular, location awareness using wireless communication is gaining attention in indoor environments composed of many obstacles, where GPS signals cannot reach. Previously, studies have focused mostly on location precision, which resulted in using many beacon nodes, not considering the initial installation and maintenance costs, communication robustness, or power consumption. This makes it difficult to apply existing methods to various fields, especially in mobile nodes (i.e., wearable devices, mobile tags, etc.) with limited battery capacity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid situation-aware indoor localization (SAIL) system for real-time indoor localization using a combination of low frequency (LF) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0. This approach allows us to work with limited battery capacity mobile devices, and identify tagged mobile nodes and their current location in relevance to the anchor node. In our experiment, we attached one anchor node at the entrance to indoor areas such as office or factory settings. Using our hybrid SAIL system, we were able to detect the passing of a mobile node through the entrance and recognize whether the node is entering or exiting the room by calculating the direction of movement as well as the distance from the entrance. This allowed us to distinguish the precise position in an indoor environment with the margin of error being 0.5 m. The signal attenuation due to obstacles is overcome by using LF communication in the 125-kHz band. This approach enables us to reduce the number of initially installed anchor nodes as well as the power consumption of the mobile node. We propose an indoor position recognition system, namely, the hybrid SAIL system, that can be applied to mobile nodes with limited battery capacity by reducing the system complexity and power consumption.

J	Zuo, Z; Liu, L; Zhang, L; Fang, Y				Zuo, Zheng; Liu, Liang; Zhang, Lei; Fang, Yong			Indoor Positioning Based on Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons Adopting Graph Optimization	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE-based indoor positioning; fingerprinting; graph optimization	LOCATION SYSTEMS	Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons-based indoor positioning is a promising method for indoor positioning, especially in applications of position-based services (PbS). It has low deployment cost and it is suitable for a wide range of mobile devices. Existing BLE beacon-based positioning methods can be categorized as range-based methods and fingerprinting-based methods. For range-based methods, the positions of the beacons should be known before positioning. For fingerprinting-based methods, a pre-requisite is the reference fingerprinting map (RFM). Many existing methods focus on how to perform the positioning assuming the beacon positions or RFM are known. However, in practical applications, determining the beacon positions or RFM in the indoor environment is normally a difficult task. This paper proposed an efficient and graph optimization-based way for estimating the beacon positions and the RFM, which combines the range-based method and the fingerprinting-based method. The method exists without need for any dedicated surveying instruments. A user equipped with a BLE-enabled mobile device walks in the region collecting inertial readings and BLE received signal strength indication (RSSI) readings. The inertial measurements are processed through the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) method to generate the constraints at adjacent poses. In addition, the BLE fingerprints are adopted to generate constraints between poses (with similar fingerprints) and the RSSIs are adopted to generate distance constraints between the poses and the beacon positions (according to a pre-defined path-loss model). The constraints are then adopted to form a cost function with a least square structure. By minimizing the cost function, the optimal user poses at different times and the beacon positions are estimated. In addition, the RFM can be generated through the pose estimations. Experiments are carried out, which validates that the proposed method for estimating the pre-requisites (including beacon positions and the RFM). These estimated pre-requisites are of sufficient quality for both range-based and fingerprinting-based positioning.

J	Zubov, D				Zubov, Dmytro			A Smart City Assistive Infrastructure for the Blind and Visually Impaired People: A Thin Client Concept	BRAIN-BROAD RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Smart City; Assistive Device; B&Vi People; Hog; Raspberry Pi 3 B		The World Health Organization pointed out that over 285 million people worldwide suffer from loss of vision and blindness, and that the number could drop drastically in just a few years. About 90 % of the blind and visually impaired (B&VI) live at a low income that means these people cannot buy the expensive assistive devices for the spatial cognition. In this work, the new concept of the smart city assistive infrastructure with distributed server-client architecture is presented for the B&VI using the inclusive smart assistive component that interacts with other subsystems of the smart city (smart buildings, smart mobility, smart energy, etc.) via IoT protocols such as MQTT. The main constituents of thin client are as follows: Raspberry Pi 3 B board with camera for the objects detection / recognition, ultrasonic sensor(s) HC-SR04 for the obstacles identification on the short-range distance up to 5 m, GPS module for the global navigation, iBeacon Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing software, MQTT IoT protocol for the mutual communication of clients, Python multithread application, Raspbian OS. The thin client hardware is of affordable price USD 70. The objects detection and recognition are implemented on the thin clients via the Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Euclidean distance classifier (HOG+EDC). The design of the recognition models, the file hosting of the training images and the knowledge base with the recognition rules are done on server(s). The modified Viola-Jones fast face detector with the combination of features "eye" and "nose" is proposed to speed up the image processing, but its detection rate is not 100 %. Hence, it can be applied only with the subsequent recognition using HOG+EDC.

This requires the control of the switch between the antenna and the control circuitry to achieve both low insertion loss and high isolation. This paper presents a low insertion loss and high isolation switch based on Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) switch for 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low power (BLE) transceiver. The body-floating technique is used to improve the insertion loss's performance. An ultra-small on-chip matching network with high Q-factor is proposed. The shunt transistors are used as active shunt capacitors that create the active matching network to improve isolation characteristics.

J	Kang, J; Seo, J; Won, Y				Kang, Jinsu; Seo, Jeonghoon; Won, Yoojae			Ephemeral ID Beacon-Based Improved Indoor Positioning System	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); location-based service (LBS); indoor localization; beacon; received signal strength indication (RSSI); Kalman filter; average filter	LOCALIZATION	Recently, the rapid development of mobile devices and communication technologies has dramatically increased the demand for location-based services that provide users with location-oriented information and services. User location in outdoor spaces is measured with high accuracy using GPS. However, because the indoor reception of GPS signals is not smooth, this solution is not viable in indoor spaces. Many on-going studies are exploring new approaches for indoor location measurement. One popular technique involves using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to measure the distance between a mobile device and the beacons and then determining the position of the user in an indoor space by applying a positioning algorithm such as the trilateration method. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate data because RSSI values are unstable owing to the influence of elements in the surrounding environment such as weather, humidity, physical barriers, and interference from other signals. In this paper, we propose an indoor location tracking system that improves performance by correcting unstable RSSI signals received from BLE beacons. We apply a filter algorithm based on the average filter and the Kalman filter to reduce the error range of results calculated using the RSSI values.

The long-term and self-sustainable operation of these wireless sensors is a key factor when designing networks using them. To prolong the lifetime of these sensors, various approaches that are capable of harvesting the required energy from various sources have been proposed over the last few years. Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) technology is one of them which shows promise in terms of availability, ease of implementation, and cost. We investigate the current status of WEH technology for IoT-enabled sensors. In particular, we evaluate the energy characteristics and operation of two types of environmental wireless sensors (one based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and the other on the UDP protocol) that are powered by a wireless energy harvesting element and operate in the IoT environment Our literature review on WEH for IoT revealed that despite significant advances that have been made in the design and development of wireless power harvesting elements, achieving self-sustainable wireless sensors for IoT remains a significant challenge. Finally, we also highlight some research challenges of WEH for IoT that need to be addressed in the future.

A smart city system aims at a seamless and secure interconnection of sensors, actuators, and data processing resources to ensure digital, efficient, and reliable services. In this article, we present a brief planar overview of a smart city system architecture by introducing the application, sensing, communication, data, and security/privacy planes. Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities. Furthermore, coexistence, integration, and control of dedicated and non-dedicated sensors is a grand challenge while loT sensors continuously push sensory data through the communication medium towards data processing and analysis planes. While pervasiveness and ubiquity of smart city services are ensured by the interaction of communication and sensing technologies, their robustness and resilience call for customized security and privacy solutions. With these in mind, we focus on sensing/actuation, communication, and security planes of a smart city system and present a comprehensive survey of the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in each plane. Furthermore, we provide insights for open issues and opportunities in these planes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on investigating the feasibility of tracking patients and clinical staff wearing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags in a radiation oncology clinic using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of these networks was compared to relative received signal strength indicator (RSSI) thresholding and triangulation. By utilizing temporal information, a combined CNN+ANN network was capable of correctly identifying the location of the BLE tag with an accuracy of 99.9%. It outperformed a CNN model (accuracy = 94%), a thresholding model employing majority voting (accuracy = 95%), and a triangulation classifier utilizing majority voting (accuracy = 95%). Future studies will seek to deploy this affordable real time location system in hospitals to improve clinical workflow, efficiency, and patient safety.

Likewise, the BLE has adopted Gaussian frequency shift-keying (GFSK) signalling due to its power and spectral efficiencies, which are the most fundamental performance criteria for modulation schemes. For this reason, it is worthwhile to research and develop transceivers that maintain these advantages and achieve a low-complexity implementation for the digital modulator and demodulator. Different techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as hardware usage optimisation, efficient pulse shaping and decomposition of the signal. This study presents a novel linear GFSK demodulator which has the following attractive advantages: low complexity, near-optimal performance in the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the possibility of operating with different GFSK modulators (with a nominal modulation index of 0.5) so it could be applied in BLE devices. In addition, the theoretical error probability is obtained and compared with simulation results.

We are moving towards an Internet of People, Things and Services (IoPTS) and a future world of ambient intelligence, where users can seamlessly interact with IoT devices and get information about the services they offer. Interaction can take place directly or through dedicated mobile apps that are built to acquire data from sensors or clusters of IoT devices. The article presents a user-centric cluster framework, taking into account the resource-constrained nature of the IoT devices. As part of the framework, the authors propose a Mobility Aware Clustering Scheme (MACS), which organizes the IoT devices in clusters using a fitness function for each node, and a Profile Aware Proactive Cluster Discovery (PAPCD) mechanism using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons for service advertisement. The authors also propose an IoT service filtering and ranking algorithm to match the users' preferences and requirements	[Shinde, Gitanjali Rahul] SKNCOE, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Olesen, Henning] Aalborg Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark	Shinde, GR (reprint author), SKNCOE, Pune, Maharashtra, India.

J	Miegel, J; Branch, P; Blamey, P				Miegel, Jonathon; Branch, Philip; Blamey, Peter			Wireless communication between personal electronic devices and hearing aids using high frequency audio and ultrasound	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							DATA-TRANSMISSION; THRESHOLDS; SOUND	Hearing aids continue to be the main intervention for hearing loss but ease of use and control is of concern due to the small size of these aids. While technological advances in Bluetooth Low Energy have allowed for improved wireless control, in particular between personal electronic devices, its use for communication with hearing aids is problematic due to limited battery life. This paper outlines the implementation of acoustic wireless communication between personal electronic devices and hearing aids using On-Off Keying (OOK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) between the frequencies of 16 and 20 kHz.

J	Park, A; Chang, H; Lee, KJ				Park, Arum; Chang, Hyejung; Lee, Kyoung Jun			How to Sustain Smart Connected Hospital Services: An Experience from a Pilot Project on IoT-Based Healthcare Services	HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS RESEARCH			English	Article						Smartphone; Mobile Applications; Radio Frequency Identification Device; Internet; Patient Safety	PRODUCTS	Objectives: This paper describes an experience of implementing seamless service trials online and offline by adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on near-field communication (NFC) tags and Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons. The services were provided for both patients and health professionals. Methods: The pilot services were implemented to enhance healthcare service quality, improve patient safety, and provide an effective business process to health professionals in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. The services to enhance healthcare service quality include healing tours, cancer information/education, psychological assessments, indoor navigation, and exercise volume checking. The services to improve patient safety are monitoring of high-risk inpatients and delivery of real-time health information in emergency situations. In addition, the services to provide an effective business process to health professionals include surveys and web services for patient management. Results: Considering the sustainability of the pilot services, we decided to pause navigation and patient monitoring services until the interference problem could be completely resolved because beacon signal interference significantly influences the quality of services. On the other hand, we had to continue to provide new wearable beacons to high-risk patients because of hygiene issues, so the cost increased over time and was much higher than expected. Conclusions: To make the smart connected hospital services sustainable, technical feasibility (e.g., beacon signal interference), economic feasibility (e.g., continuous provision of new necklace beacons), and organizational commitment and support (e.g., renewal of new alternative medical devices and infrastructure) are required.

Since these cameras acquire and process sensitive and vulnerable data in applications such as surveillance or monitoring, security is essential to avoid cyberattacks. However, cameras on mobile devices have constraints in size, computation and power consumption, so that lightweight security techniques should be considered. Camera identification techniques guarantee the origin of the data. Among the camera identification techniques, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) allow generating unique, distinctive and unpredictable identifiers from the hardware of a device. PUFs are also very suitable to obfuscate secret keys (by binding them to the hardware of the device) and generate random sequences (employed as nonces). In this work, we propose a trusted camera based on PUFs and standard cryptographic algorithms. In addition, a protocol is proposed to protect the communication with the trusted camera, which satisfies authentication, confidentiality, integrity and freshness in the data communication. This is particularly interesting to carry out camera control actions and firmware updates. PUFs from Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) are selected because cameras typically include SRAMs in its hardware. Therefore, additional hardware is not required and security techniques can be implemented at low cost. Experimental results are shown to prove how the proposed solution can be implemented with the SRAM of commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips included in the communication module of the camera. A proof of concept shows that the proposed solution can be implemented in low-cost cameras.

The design and construction of the device are discussed. The authors have considered the best placement of the sensor, on the body, to gain the most accurate readings of user stress levels, under various conditions. Trial tests were performed on a group of sixteen people to verify the correct functioning of the device. Resistance levels were compared to those from the reference system. The placement of the sensor has also been determined, based on wearer convenience. With the Bluetooth Low Energy block, users can be notified immediately about their abnormal stress levels via a smartphone application.

To provide flexibility, the system is modular and each sensor functions independently. The whole solution is small, compact, light, and wrist worn. It is working in low power consumption mode and operates for several hours. The device has two layers to implement the sensors and one layer for a warning system driver to enable the vibrating motor and beeper in emergency status. The forth layer is the hardware flex interface that is connected to the display and sound module and provides the possibility of the hardware extension for further development. The gas sensor node includes the sensor attached to the driver (located at the top) and is replaceable with other target gas sensors from the same family. The warning system is located at the bottom of the proposed device. The sampled data from the sensors are monitored in real time via the display and are sent to an Android smartphone for permanent storage via Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) 4.1. Consequently, these data will he directed to a cloud for further medical analyses. Power consumption, results, device efficiency, and packet protocol justification are evaluated in this paper.

Such autonomous control is of paramount importance for several deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT), including smart manufacturing applications, healthcare systems and home automation just to name a few. As a result, several M2M technologies are nowadays available on the market as either proprietary solutions or the effort of standardization initiatives, each targeted for a specific class of IoT applications and characterized by unique features in terms of achievable performance, frequency in use and supported network topologies. In this paper, we aim to organize the existing M2M approaches and technologies into a consistent framework that provides an in-depth vision of the main trends, future directions and open issues. We provide three main contributions in this survey. First, we identify the main use cases and requirements of M2M scenarios and we introduce a multi-layer taxonomy for M2M solutions, taking into account both deployment types and PHY/MAC characteristics. Second, in light of such characteristics, we provide an in-depth review of the existing M2Mwireless technologies, considering both proprietary and open/standardized solutions for proximity-based, short-range and large-scale networks. Finally, we perform a critical comparison of the surveyed solutions over different M2M use cases and requirements, and we identify the research directions and open issues that still have to be addressed.

While BLE was originally designed for star topology networks only, recent developments have focused on enabling mesh network topology support for BLE. An emerging category of BLE mesh network initiatives is based on routing data units over BLE data channels. This letter investigates the fundamental connectivity parameters of data-channel-based BLE mesh networks, such as the probability of no isolation of a node and network K -connectivity. We provide an analytical model for both parameters which is validated by means of extensive simulations.

J	Lee, SH; Lim, KS				Lee, Seoung-Hyeon; Lim, Kyung-Soo			Indoor positioning method using BITON and linear Kalman filter	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Indoor positioning service; Beacon; BITON; LKF; UNIWAY		This study proposes an indoor positioning system using the BITON algorithm, a linear Kalman filter (LKF), and beacons. A beacon is an indoor positioning device that uses Bluetooth low-energy technology. Indoor location-based services that use existing beacons provide information to adjacent devices in specific areas, such as shopping and sightseeing locations. When indoor location-based services are active, and beacons are installed in many areas, space-based services become important. In space-based services, it is important to improve the accuracy of user locations, which are calculated using information from the beacon. In this paper, we propose a method for improving user positioning accuracy indoors using BITON and LKF. First, we analyze the characteristics of a beacon signal (with fading) and calculate a correction value for the received signal strength indication, from the predicted range. Because the beacon signal has nonlinear properties, the BITON algorithm is used to translate user movements into linear motion. The LKF algorithm uses the predicted user location and beacon coordinates to calculate the exact indoor location coordinates of a user. Additionally, when the proposed method is applied, indoor positioning results with mean errors of 0.504 and 0.6251 from the x- and y-coordinates can be confirmed.

Many services and applications, such as navigation assistance, surveillance of patients and social networking, have been developed based on users' position. Although the GPS plays an important role in positioning systems, its signal strength is extremely weak inside buildings. Thus, other sensing devices are necessary to improve the accuracy of indoor localisation. In the past decade, researchers have developed a series of indoor positioning technologies based on the received signal strength (RSS) of WiFi, ZigBee or Bluetooth devices under the infrastructure of wireless sensor network for location estimation. We can compute the distance of the devices by measuring their RSS, but the correctness of the result is unsatisfactory because the radio signal interference is a considerable issue and the indoor radio propagation is too complicated to model. Using the location fingerprint to estimate a target position is a feasible strategy because the location fingerprint records the characteristics of the signals and the signal strength is related to the space relation. This type of algorithm estimates the location of a target by matching online measurements with the closest a-priori location fingerprints. The matching or classification algorithm is a key issue in the correctness of location fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose an effective location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node. The grid points are trained with an interval of 2 m, and the estimated position error is about 1.8 m. Thus, the proposed method is low computation consumption, and with an acceptable accuracy.

J	Aimonetto, MB; Fiori, F				Aimonetto, Marco Brignone; Fiori, Franco			Investigation on the Susceptibility of BLE Receivers to Power Switching Noise	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY			English	Article						Antenna parasitic coupling; bluetooth low energy (BLE); electromagnetic susceptibility; low frequency EMC; wireless systems EMC		In this paper Radio Frequency transceivers operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band are analyzed and tested. Electromagnetic interference collected by antennas can propagate in the receiver front-end causing communication errors. Therefore, the parasitic coupling between PCB printed antenna and an interference source is discussed through simulations and a lumped-element equivalent circuit is proposed. The main causes of errors induced by low-frequency electromagnetic interference are analyzed referring to two different front-end integrated circuits. The low noise amplifier is considered responsible for communication errors. The susceptibility of the receiver to EMI is evaluated by injecting low-frequency interfering waveforms in the receiver front-end once the wireless communication is established. The susceptibility criteria used are the packet error rate and the number of packets lost. Vulnerability to low-frequency interference was found. Some practical design guidelines are discussed for systems incorporating both RF transceiver and power switching circuits.

However, their experiences of system adoption or pilot testing via implementation were not shared with others or evaluated in a real environment. Therefore, we aimed to share our experiences and insight regarding a real-time location system, obtained via the implementation and operation of a real-time asset tracking system based on Bluetooth Low Energy/WiFi in a tertiary care hospital, which can be used to improve hospital efficiency and nursing workflow. Methods: We developed tags that were attached to relevant assets paired with Bluetooth Low Energy sensor beacons, which served as the basis of the asset tracking system. Problems with the system were identified during implementation and operation, and the feasibility of introducing the system was evaluated via a satisfaction survey completed by end users after 3 months of use. Results: The results showed that 117 nurses who had used the asset tracking system for 3 months were moderately satisfied (2.7 to 3.4 out of 5) with the system, rated it as helpful, and were willing to continue using it. In addition, we identified 4 factors (end users, target assets, tracking area, and type of sensor) that should be considered in the development of asset tracking systems, and 4 issues pertaining to usability (the active tag design, technical limitations, solution functions, and operational support). Conclusions: The successful introduction of asset tracking systems based on real-time location in hospitals requires the selection of clear targets (e.g., users and assets) via analysis of the user environment and implementation of appropriate technical improvements in the system as required (e.g., miniaturization of the tag size and improvement of the sensing accuracy).

The proposed algorithm decreases the peak load and electricity bill by deferring starting times of delay-tolerant appliances from peak to off-peak hours, controlling the temperature setting of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and properly scheduling the discharging and charging periods of an EV. In this paper, the user comfort is evaluated by means of QoE functions. To preserve the user's QoE, the delay of the starting time of a home appliance and the temperature setting of HVAC are constrained by a QoE threshold. Additionally, to solve the trade-off problem between the peak load/electricity bill reduction and user's QoE, a fuzzy logic controller for dynamically adjusting the QoE threshold to optimize the user's QoE was also designed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed smart appliance control algorithm with a fuzzy-controlled QoE threshold significantly reduces the peak load and electricity bill while optimally preserving the user's QoE. Compared with the baseline case, the proposed scheme reduces the electricity bill by 65% under the scenario with RES and EV. Additionally, compared with the method of optimal scheduling of appliances in the literature, the proposed scheme achieves much better peak load reduction performance and user's QoE.

The world is quickly shifting towards the wireless with phenomena akin to the Internet of Thing (IoT) accelerating this progression. Technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy and Radio Frequency Identification are greatly entwined with this trend, and research has been made into reinforcing protection methods. However, security is a choice made by the designer and more often than not is given decreased priority. With the improved creativity and sophistication of malicious exploits this is becoming far less acceptable. Theft of data is trivial for a user with the correct skillset and will be successful without proper defences. Further research needs to be done in the field, and encouraging consistent security practices is an appropriate start.

It provides a low-energy and low-cost solution for short-range radio transmissions. Bluetooth, more specifically Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become the predominant technology for connecting IoT (Internet of Things). It can be found in cell phones, headsets, speakers, printers, keyboards, automobiles, children's toys, and medical devices, as well as many other devices. The technology can also be found in automated smart homes, to provide monitors and controls for lights, thermostats, door locks, appliances, security systems, and cameras. Bluetooth offers convenience and ease of use, but it lacks a centralized security infrastructure. As a result, it has serious security vulnerabilities, and the need for awareness of the security risks are increasing as the technology becomes more widespread. This paper presents an overview of Bluetooth technology in IoT including its security, vulnerabilities, threats, and risk mitigation solutions, as well as real-life examples of exploits. Our study highlights the importance of understanding attack risks and mitigation techniques involved with using Bluetooth technology on our devices. Real-life examples of recent Bluetooth exploits are presented. Several recommended security measures are discussed to secure Bluetooth communication.

While its digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) runs directly at 0.5 V, an internal switched-capacitor dc-dc converter "doubles" the supply voltage to all the digital circuitry and particularly regulates the time-to-digital converter (TDC) supply to stabilize its resolution, thus maintaining fixed in-band phase noise (PN) across process, voltage, and temperature (PVT). The ADPLL supports a two-point modulation and forms a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter realized in 28-nm CMOS. It maintains in-band PN of -106 dBc/Hz [figure of merit (FoM) of -239.2 dB] and rms jitter of 0.86 ps while dissipating only 1.6 mW at 40-MHz reference. The power consumption reduces to 0.8 mW during the BLE transmission when the DCO switches to open loop.

A Regulation-Free Sub-0.5-V 16-/24-MHz Crystal Oscillator With 14.2-nJ Startup Energy and 31.8-mu W Steady-State Power	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); chirping; CMOS; crystal oscillator (XO); duty-cycling; energy harvesting (EH); fast startup; Internet-of-Things (IoT); ultralow power (ULP); ultralow voltage (ULV)	CMOS; DESIGN; SYSTEM; SOLAR	This paper reports a regulation-free sub-0.5-V crystal oscillator (XO). The XO specifically designed for Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radios aims for direct-powering by the harvested energy. To secure its performance against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, while reducing its startup time and energy, we propose a dual-mode g(m) scheme and a scalable self-reference chirp injection (SSCI) technique. The former employs an inductive multistage g(m) to mitigate the crystal's stray capacitance during the startup, but a single-stage g(m) in the steady state to preserve the phase noise (PN). For the latter (SSCI), we generate a scalable chirping sequence to kick-start the XO, avoiding trimming of the auxiliary oscillator. The XO fabricated in 65-nm CMOS is measured with two common crystals (16/24 MHz) over a 0.3-to-0.5-V supply. At 24 MHz and 0.35 V, the startup time and energy of the XO are 400 mu s and 14.2 nJ, respectively, while showing a steady-state power of 31.8 mu W and a PN of -134 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset. The frequency stability is 14.1 ppm against temperature (-40 degrees C-90 degrees C) and 17.9 ppm against voltage (0.3-0.5 V), both conform to the BLE standard (+/- 50 ppm) with adequate margin.

Microlocation for Smart Buildings in the Era of the Internet of Things A survey of technologies, techniques, and approaches	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE			English	Article							FILTERS; BEACONS	Microlocation plays a key role in the transformation of traditional buildings into smart infrastructure. Microlocation is the process of locating any entity with a very high accuracy, possibly in centimeters. Such technologies require high detection accuracy, energy efficiency, wide reception range, low cost, and availability. In this article, we provide in-sights into various microlocation-enabling technologies, techniques, and services and discuss how they can accelerate the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart buildings.

J	Bittner, AK; Jacobson, AJ; Khan, R				Bittner, Ava Katherine; Jacobson, Andrew J.; Khan, Rakin			Feasibility of Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon Sensors to Detect Magnifier Usage by Low Vision Patients	OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; OUTCOMES	SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated proof of concept for the potential for Bluetooth low energy beacons to reliably collect data to serve as an indicator that low vision patients are using handheld magnifiers for reading, which might be used in the future to prevent the abandonment of magnification or other assistive devices. PURPOSE: Bluetooth low energy beacons are an emerging novel technology involving tiny sensors that collect real-time, continuous, objective data, which might help to ascertain the abandonment of low vision devices in a timely manner, thus prompting a follow-up evaluation to attempt to resolve issues. We evaluated whether Bluetooth beacon data could indicate when low vision patients used handheld optical magnifiers for reading. METHODS: We recorded temperature and/or relative humidity data from Estimote sticker and BlueMaestro Tempo Disc beacons attached to handles of optical magnifiers used for reading by low vision patients in clinic (n = 16) and at home (n = 3). RESULTS: In the clinic, patients whose hand/fingers made direct versus indirect contact with Estimote beacons had greater temperature increases on average from baseline after 30 seconds (0.73 degrees C vs. 0.28 degrees C), 60 seconds (1.04 degrees C vs. 0.40 degrees C), 90 seconds (1.39 degrees C vs. 0.60 degrees C), 105 to 120 seconds (1.59 degrees C vs. 0.62 degrees C), and 135 to 150 seconds (2.07 degrees C vs. 0.97 degrees C). During magnifier usage at home, BlueMaestro beacons measured rapidly increased temperature (5.6 degrees C per minute on average; range 2.7 to 7.3 degrees C) and relative humidity (19.4% per minute on average; range 8.7 to 34%). Humidity tended to reach its maximum increase and return back to baseline significantly more quickly than temperature (P = .007). All increases during magnifier usage were much greater than the maximum room fluctuations without use (clinic, 0.2 degrees C over 120 seconds; home, 0.6 degrees C and 2.4% over 1 minute). The beacons were nonintrusive and acceptable by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Estimote and BlueMaestro beacons can reliably detect temperature and/or humidity increases when held by low vision patients while reading with a magnifier.

A Coin-Battery-Powered LDO-Free 2.4-GHz Bluetooth Low-Energy Transmitter With 34.7% Peak System Efficiency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS			English	Article						Battery capacity usage (BCU); Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); CMOS; direct-coin-battery-powered (DCBP); output power; power amplifier (PA); system efficiency	CMOS; DBM	This brief reports a 2.4-GHz Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter (TX) that can operate against a coin-battery voltage discharging from 1.5 to 1 V, corresponding to a 99.2% battery capacity usage. Specifically, a class-B/C push-pull power amplifier with dual feedback control loops is proposed to dynamically adjust two gate biases, ensuring stable output power and low output HD2. The TX fabricated in 65-nm CMOS occupies a die area of 0.5 mm(2) and achieves three stable power levels: P (out),(H) (2.7 +/- 0.4 dBm) ,P-out,P-M (-0.1 +/- 0.6 dBm), and P-out,P-L (-2.5 +/- 0.8 dBm). At P-out,(H), the system efficiency reaches 34.7%. The 1-Mb/s GFSK output (m = 0.5) and HD(2,3 )comply with the BLE specifications, and the FSK error is 8.2%. A tiny demo board with an antenna, a crystal, and a coin battery (Nanfu LR44) verities the feasibility of the TX over-the-air, achieving 27.5 h of continuous operation for a 1-dB reduction of the received power.

A low power ADPLL with a Retimer, 2-stage time to digital converter, and gain estimation technique is proposed to achieve low-power direct FSK modulation at 1 Mbps data rate. A high-efficiency class-D power amplifier, with dual output power modes and a ramping digital filter (RDF), is proposed to reduce the spurious tones. The proposed TX is implemented on 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology with a die size of 0.53 mm(2). The phase noise is -119 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset with frequency of 2.44 GHz. TX output power levels of 1.6 and 10 dBm have a power consumption of 3.9 and 18 mW, respectively. The power control ranges for the 1.6 and 10 dBm modes are 25 and 23 dB, respectively. With the RDF, when the output level is + 1.6 dBm, the second, and third harmonic distortions at the TX output are -44 and -49 dBm, respectively. The proposed TX achieves an error vector magnitude of 3.48% at an output power level of + 1.6 dBm.

J	Topak, F; Pekericli, MK; Tanyer, AM				Topak, Fatih; Pekericli, Mehmet Koray; Tanyer, Ali Murat			Technological Viability Assessment of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Indoor Localization	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Indoor localization; Bluetooth low energy; Location fingerprinting; k-nearest neighbor	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT; OPERATIONS; COMPONENTS; OCCUPANCY; NETWORKS	Localization in indoor built environments has considerable importance for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. It has various use cases, including building occupancy detection, automated asset tracking in construction sites, supporting facility maintenance and operations, and guiding people in building emergency response operations. Although some initial studies examining the usability of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor localization exist in the literature, there is still a gap for a comprehensive analysis that will lead to the establishment of a widely accepted BLE-based localization framework. Whereas existing studies mainly focus on radio signal properties and use only spatial accuracy and precision as their evaluation criteria, this study determines the technological viability of BLE through predetermined guidance parameters such as human body orientation, number of data collection points, number of real-time received signal strength index (RSSI) data samples, and fingerprinting creation approaches. In order to determine the viability of BLE-based localization, multiple field experiments are carried out in the building of a research center. Location fingerprinting method is used as the wireless localization technique and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to assess the feasibility of BLE technology for indoor localization. The results of the field experiments show that BLE technology can be used as a reliable solution for indoor localization because it gives better accuracy and precision results than existing approaches in the industry.

However, an adversary can maliciously influence such controls indirectly by manipulating the environment in which the sensors are monitoring, thereby granting privileges the adversary would otherwise not normally have. To address such context monitoring issues, we extend CASSEC by incorporating sentience-like constructs, which enable the emulation of "confidence", into our proximity-based access control model to grant the system the ability to make more inferable decisions based on the degree of reliability of extracted contextual information. In CASSEC 2.0, we evaluate our confidence constructs by implementing two new authentication mechanisms. Co-proximity authentication employs our time-based challenge-response protocol, which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy beacons as its underlying occupancy detection technology. Biometric authentication relies on the accelerometer and fingerprint sensors to measure behavioral and physiological user features to prevent unauthorized users from using an authorized user's device. We provide a feasibility study demonstrating how confidence constructs can improve the decision engine of context-aware access control systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the constraints of processing, memory and power consumption are very high in these nodes. Cryptographic algorithms based on symmetric key are very suitable for them. The drawback is that secure storage of secret keys is required. In this work, a low-cost solution is presented to obfuscate secret keys with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), which exploit the hardware identity of the node. In addition, a lightweight fingerprint recognition solution is proposed, which can be implemented in low-cost sensor nodes. Since biometric data of individuals are sensitive, they are also obfuscated with PUFs. Both solutions allow authenticating the origin of the sensed data with a proposed dual-factor authentication protocol. One factor is the unique physical identity of the trusted sensor node that measures them. The other factor is the physical presence of the legitimate individual in charge of authorizing their transmission. Experimental results are included to prove how the proposed PUF-based solution can be implemented with the SRAMs of commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips which belong to the communication module of the sensor node. Implementation results show how the proposed fingerprint recognition based on the novel texture-based feature named QFingerMap16 (QFM) can be implemented fully inside a low-cost sensor node. Robustness, security and privacy issues at the proposed sensor nodes are discussed and analyzed with experimental results from PUFs and fingerprints taken from public and standard databases.

J	Baert, M; Rossey, J; Shahid, A; Hoebeke, J				Baert, Mathias; Rossey, Jen; Shahid, Adnan; Hoebeke, Jeroen			The Bluetooth Mesh Standard: An Overview and Experimental Evaluation	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE; Bluetooth Mesh; round-trip-time; IoT; scalability; performance; interoperability	LOW-ENERGY	Mesh networks enable a many-to-many relation between nodes, which means that each node in the network can communicate with every other node using multi-hop communication and path diversity. As it enables the fast roll-out of sensor and actuator networks, it is an important aspect within the Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an underlying technology to implement such mesh networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years. The result was a variety of BLE meshing solutions that were not interoperable because of the lack of a common standard. This has changed recently with the advent of the Bluetooth Mesh standard. However, a detailed overview of how this standard operates, performs and how it tackles other issues concerning BLE mesh networking is missing. Therefore, this paper investigates this new technology thoroughly and evaluates its performance by means of three approaches, namely an experimental evaluation, a statistical approach and a graph-based simulation model, which can be used as the basis for future research. Apart from showing that consistent results are achieved by means of all three approaches, we also identify possible drawbacks and open issues that need to be dealt with.

We have developed a wireless opto-electro interface (WOENI) device, which combines electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording and optical stimulation for bi-directional neuromodulation on small, freely behaving animals, such as rodents. Approach. The device is comprised of two components, a detachable headstage and an implantable polyimide-based substrate. The headstage establishes a bluetooth low energy (BLE) bi-directional data communication with an external custom-designed USB dongle for receiving user commands and optogenetic stimulation patterns, and sending digitalized ECoG data. Main results. The functionality and stability of the device were evaluated in vivo on freely behaving rats. When the animal received optical stimulation on the primary visual cortex (V1) and visual stimulation via eyes, spontaneous changes in ECoG signals were recorded from both left and right V1 during four consecutive experiments with 7 d intervals over a time span of 21 d following device implantation. Immunostained tissue analyses showed results consistent with ECoG analyses, validating the efficacy of optical stimulation to upregulate the activity of cortical neurons expressing ChR2. Significance. The proposed WOENI device is potentially a versatile tool in the studies that involve long-term optogenetic neuromodulation.

Wireless Capacitive-Based ECG Sensing for Feature Extraction and Mobile Health Monitoring	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						ECG; respiration rate; capacitive sensing; active electrode; wireless wearable sensing; remote health monitoring	ELECTRODES; SENSOR	In this paper, the concept of a wireless wearable device capable of measuring electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration rate (RR) through the use of non-contact capacitive-based electrodes was designed and implemented. Both ECG and RR were measured using only the active electrodes and an analog conditioning circuit. The device utilizes Bluetooth low energy for low-power wireless communication to the remote server. The measured data is used to calculate heart rate variability, RR, and extract ECG related features. It was found that the use of non-contact active chest electrodes is a viable approach for measurement. The system focuses on user comfort and the minimization of the ratio of the number of wearable sensors to sensed physiological parameters.

MEMS gas sensors are composed of four microheaters mounting heterogeneous sensing nanomaterials (SnO2 nanotubes and ZnO nanowires with/without a Pt catalyst) and operating power is only 6 mW per each heater. A comprehensive approach to control heaters and readout multiple resistive sensors is implemented on a printed circuit board through the combination of analog/digital signal processing and a highly reconfigurable circuit structure. A wide range of sensor resistance (1 k Omega-100 M Omega) can be read with a relative error less than 1% by adaptively adjusting the gain of a trans-impedance amplifier. Heater controller circuits are operated in a way to give optimized power for each heater, and the target power is maintained at a constant value to keep a stable temperature condition. The module's multiple gas sensing capability enables selectivity enhancement by principle component analysis (PCA). Operation mode is readily reprogrammed to give repetitive sleep mode, and it is demonstrated that fabricated sensors show decent response and recovery to frequent heater on/off repetition. For both of portable and stationary applications, Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi communication is realized through a RF-microcontroller combination system-on-chip (SoC). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based sensors can be considered as a solution for monitoring personal vital signs data. In this study, we propose a personalized healthcare monitoring system by utilizing a BLE-based sensor device, real-time data processing, and machine learning-based algorithms to help diabetic patients to better self-manage their chronic condition. BLEs were used to gather users' vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose (BG) from sensor nodes to smartphones, while real-time data processing was utilized to manage the large amount of continuously generated sensor data. The proposed real-time data processing utilized Apache Kafka as a streaming platform and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the patient. The results show that commercial versions of the BLE-based sensors and the proposed real-time data processing are sufficiently efficient to monitor the vital signs data of diabetic patients. Furthermore, machine learning based classification methods were tested on a diabetes dataset and showed that a Multilayer Perceptron can provide early prediction of diabetes given the user's sensor data as input. The results also reveal that Long Short-Term Memory can accurately predict the future BG level based on the current sensor data. In addition, the proposed diabetes classification and BG prediction could be combined with personalized diet and physical activity suggestions in order to improve the health quality of patients and to avoid critical conditions in the future.

A Plug-and-Play Human-Centered Virtual TEDS Architecture for the Web of Things	SENSORS			English	Article						sensors; actuators; TEDS; IEEE 21451; Internet of Things; Web of Things; smart sensors; smart transducers; interoperability; human-centered services	AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEMS; PLATFORM	This article presents a Virtual Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (VTEDS)-based framework for the development of intelligent sensor nodes with plug-and-play capabilities in order to contribute to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) toward the Web of Things (WoT). It makes use of new lightweight protocols that allow sensors to self-describe, auto-calibrate, and auto-register. Such protocols enable the development of novel IoT solutions while guaranteeing low latency, low power consumption, and the required Quality of Service (QoS). Thanks to the developed human-centered tools, it is possible to configure and modify dynamically IoT device firmware, managing the active transducers and their communication protocols in an easy and intuitive way, without requiring any prior programming knowledge. In order to evaluate the performance of the system, it was tested when using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ethernet-based smart sensors in different scenarios. Specifically, user experience was quantified empirically (i.e., how fast the system shows collected data to a user was measured). The obtained results show that the proposed VTED architecture is very fast, with some smart sensors (located in Europe) able to self-register and self-configure in a remote cloud (in South America) in less than 3 s and to display data to remote users in less than 2 s.

Unlike other sensory stimuli (specifically sight and sound), digital olfactory technology has yet to have wide-spread commercial success. Our proposed system will release up to eight different liquid phase aromas (essential oils) using a thermal mechanism. The unit contains a speed controlled fan, temperature control of the heating element, and a gas sensor to provide feedback to inform the release rate. It can be connected (via Bluetooth low energy) to a tablet/computer to control the timing and intensity of the aroma.

BLE Mesh: A Practical Mesh Networking Development Framework for Public Safety Communications	TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						public safety communications; device to device; bluetooth low energy; mesh networking; development framework		Owing to advanced storage and communication capabilities today, smart devices have become the basic interface between individuals and their surrounding environment. In particular, massive devices connect to one other directly in a proximity area, thereby enabling abundant Proximity Services (ProSe), which can be classified into two categories: public safety communication and social discovery. However, two challenges impede the quick development and deployment of ProSe applications. From the viewpoint of networking, no multi-hop connectivity functionality component can be directly operated on commercially off-the-shelf devices, and from the programming viewpoint, an easily reusable development framework is lacking for developers with minimal knowledge of the underlying communication technologies and connectivity. Considering these two issues, this paper makes a twofold contribution. First, a multi-hop mesh networking based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is implemented, in which a proactive routing mechanism with link-quality (i.e., received signal strength indication) assistance is designed. Second, a ProSe development framework called BLE Mesh is designed and implemented, which can provide significant benefits for application developers, framework maintenance professionals, and end users. Rich application programming interfaces can help developers to build ProSe apps easily and quickly. Dependency inversion principle and template method pattern allow modules in BLE Mesh to be loosely coupled and easy to maintain and update. Callback mechanism enables modules to work smoothly together and automation processes such as registration, node discovery, and messaging are employed to offer nearly zero-configuration for end users. Finally, based on the designed ProSe development kit, a public safety communications app called QuoteSendApp is built to distribute emergency information in close area without Internet access. The process illustrates the easy usability of BLE Mesh to develop ProSe apps.

Twelve capture tags were attached to a custom cart with fixed distances of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.8 m. The cart was pushed along a predetermined course following the lines of a standard dimensions Basketball court. The course was performed at low speed (<10.0 km/h), medium speed (>10.0 km/h and <20.0 km/h) and high speed (>20.0 km/h). Root mean square error (RMSE) and percentage of variance accounted for (%VAF) were used as accuracy measures. The obtained data showed acceptable accuracy results for both RMSE and %VAF, despite the expected degree of error in position measurement at higher speeds. The RMSE for all the distances and velocities presented an average absolute error of 0.30 +/- 0.13 cm with 90.61 +/- 8.34 of %VAF, in line with most available systems, and considered acceptable for indoor sports. The processing of data with filter correction seemed to reduce the noise and promote a lower relative error, increasing the %VAF for each measured distance. Research using positional-derived variables in Basketball is still very scarce; thus, this independent test of the NBN23((R)) tracking system provides accuracy details and opens up opportunities to develop new performance indicators that help to optimize training adaptations and performance.

To efficiently monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and the levels of pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air, and to collect data covering vast geographical areas, the development of cheap energy-autonomous sensors for large scale deployment and fine-grained data acquisition is required. Rapid advances in electronics and communication technologies along with the emergence of paradigms such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to the development of low-cost sensor devices that can operate unattended for long periods of time and communicate using wired or wireless connections through the Internet. We investigate the energy efficiency of an environmental monitoring system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that operate in the IoT environment. The beacons developed measure the temperature, the relative humidity, the light intensity, and the CO2 and VOC levels in the air. Based on our analysis we have developed efficient sleep scheduling algorithms that allow the sensor nodes developed to operate autonomously without requiring the replacement of the power supply. The experimental results show that low-power sensors communicating using BLE technology can operate autonomously (from the energy perspective) in applications that monitor the environment or the air quality in indoor or outdoor settings.

Most pedestrian positioning systems have drift error and large bias due to low-cost inertial sensors and random motions of human being, as well as unpredictable and time-varying radio-frequency (RF) signals used for position determination. To solve this problem, many indoor positioning approaches that integrate the user's motion estimated by dead reckoning (DR) method and the location data obtained by RSS fingerprinting through Bayesian filter, such as the Kalman filter (KF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and particle filter (PF), have recently been proposed to achieve higher positioning accuracy in indoor environments. Among Bayesian filtering methods, PF is the most popular integrating approach and can provide the best localization performance. However, since PF uses a large number of particles for the high performance, it can lead to considerable computational cost. This paper presents an indoor positioning system implemented on a smartphone, which uses simple dead reckoning (DR), RSS fingerprinting using iBeacon and machine learning scheme, and improved KF. The core of the system is the enhanced KF called a sigma-point Kalman particle filter (SKPF), which localize the user leveraging both the unscented transform of UKF and the weighting method of PF. The SKPF algorithm proposed in this study is used to provide the enhanced positioning accuracy by fusing positional data obtained from both DR and fingerprinting with uncertainty. The SKPF algorithm can achieve better positioning accuracy than KF and UKF and comparable performance compared to PF, and it can provide higher computational efficiency compared with PF. iBeacon in our positioning system is used for energy-efficient localization and RSS fingerprinting. We aim to design the localization scheme that can realize the high positioning accuracy, computational efficiency, and energy efficiency through the SKPF and iBeacon indoors. Empirical experiments in real environments show that the use of the SKPF algorithm and iBeacon in our indoor localization scheme can achieve very satisfactory performance in terms of localization accuracy, computational cost, and energy efficiency.

Researchers from all over the world have proposed many solutions for indoor positioning over the past several years. However, owing to the dynamic and complex nature of indoor environments, accurately and efficiently localising targets in indoor environments remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning algorithm based on the received signal strength indication and pedestrian dead reckoning. In order to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our proposed probabilistic position selection algorithm in mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, a low-complexity identification approach is proposed to identify the change in the channel situation between NLOS and LOS. Numerical experiment results indicate that our proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy and is less impacted by NLOS errors than other conventional methods in mixed LOS and NLOS indoor environments.

The BLE 4.0 protocol supports only the piconet topology and does not support data transfer over multiple nodes. To overcome this limitation a mechanism to relay sensor data over multiple BLE 4.0 nodes using Master/Slave switching was developed. The mechanism dynamically creates communication paths within the BLE ad-hoc sensor network where all BLE nodes are identical. The sensor data query is initiated from a designated node and forwarded through the dynamically build network. the sensor data are collected over the same path, back to the designated node. The mechanism does not perform route discovery therefore no routing tables are needed. Using this mechanism, the range of the sensor data acquisition can be extended from BLE range to whole BLE sensor network.

The cellular clocks outside the brain are effectively coordinated by the body temperature rhythm. We hypothesized that concurrent measurements of body temperature and rest-activity rhythms would assess circadian clocks coordination in individual patients, thus enabling the integration of biological rhythms into precision medicine. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the circadian clocks' coordination in healthy subjects and patients through simultaneous measurements of rest-activity and body temperature rhythms. Methods: Noninvasive real-time measurements of rest-activity and chest temperature rhythms were recorded during the subject's daily life, using a dedicated new mobile electronic health platform (PiCADo). It involved a chest sensor that jointly measured accelerations, 3D orientation, and skin surface temperature every 1-5 min and relayed them out to a mobile gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy. The gateway tele-transmitted all stored data to a server via General Packet Radio Service every 24 hours. The technical capabilities of PiCADo were validated in 55 healthy subjects and 12 cancer patients, whose rhythms were e-monitored during their daily routine for 3-30 days. Spectral analyses enabled to compute rhythm parameters values, with their 90% confidence limits, and their dynamics in each subject. Results: All the individuals displayed a dominant circadian rhythm in activity with maxima occurring from 12:09 to 20:25. This was not the case for the dominant temperature period, which clustered around 24 hours for 51 out of 67 subjects (76%), and around 12 hours for 13 others (19%). Statistically significant sex- and age-related differences in circadian coordination were identified in the noncancerous subjects, based upon the range of variations in temperature rhythm amplitudes, maxima (acrophases), and phase relations with rest-activity. The circadian acrophase of chest temperature was located at night for the majority of people, but it occurred at daytime for 26% (14/55) of the noncancerous people and 33% (4/12) of the cancer patients, thus supporting important intersubject differences in circadian coordination. Sex, age, and cancer significantly impacted the circadian coordination of both rhythms, based on their phase relationships. Conclusions: Complementing rest-activity with chest temperature circadian e-monitoring revealed striking intersubject differences regarding human circadian clocks' coordination and timing during daily routine. To further delineate the clinical importance of such finding, the PiCADo platform is currently applied for both the assessment of health effects resulting from atypical work schedules and the identification of the key determinants of circadian disruption in cancer patients.

Application examples include location-based information and advertisements, logistics, social networking, file sharing, etc. In this paper, we consider positioning of devices based on a time series of proximity reports from a mobile device to a network node. This corresponds to nonlinear measurements with respect to the device position in relation to the network nodes. Motion model will be needed together with the measurements to determine the position of the device. Therefore, sequential Monte Carlo methods, namely particle filtering and smoothing, are applicable for positioning. Positioning performance is evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-low-energy beacons deployed for proximity detection and report, and is further compared to parametric Cramer-Rao lower bounds. Finally, the position accuracy is also evaluated with real experimental data.

The processing in the analog domain is based on simple well-known RADAR amplitude monopulse antenna techniques. Then, using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) delivered by a commercial MiMo WiFi cards, the DoA is estimated using the so-called digital monopulse function. Due to the hybrid analog digital architecture, the digital processing is extremely simple, so that DoA estimation is performed without using IQ data from specific hardware. The simplicity and robustness of the proposed hybrid analog digital MiMo architecture is demonstrated for the ISM 2.45 GHz WiFi band. Also, the limitations with respect to multipath effects are studied in detail. As a proof of concept, an array of two MiMo WiFi DoA monopulse readers is distributed to localize the two-dimensional position of WiFi devices. This cost-effective hybrid solution can be applied to all WiFi standards and other Internet of Things narrowband radio protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy or Zigbee.

In large spaces, multiple HVAC terminals are typically installed to provide cooperative services for different thermal zones, and the occupancy information determines the cooperation among terminals. However, a person count at room-level does not adequately optimize HVAC system operation due to the movement of occupants within the room that creates uneven load distribution. Without accurate knowledge of the occupants' spatial distribution, the uneven distribution of occupants often results in under-cooling/heating or over-cooling/heating in some thermal zones. Therefore, the lack of high-resolution occupancy distribution is often perceived as a bottleneck for future improvements to HVAC operation efficiency. To fill this gap, this study proposes a multi-feature k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm to extract occupancy distribution through reliable, low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. An on-site experiment was conducted in a typical office of an institutional building to demonstrate the proposed methods, and the experiment outcomes of three case studies were examined to validate detection accuracy. One method based on City Block Distance (CBD) was used to measure the distance between detected occupancy distribution and ground truth and assess the results of occupancy distribution. The results show the accuracy when CBD = 1 is over 71.4% and the accuracy when CBD = 2 can reach up to 92.9%.

The DCO core is designed to operate in the subthreshold region. The DCO power consumption is reduced mainly by maintaining the constant current over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations in the oscillator core via an adjustable low-dropout (LDO) regulator. The power consumption is also reduced by employing gm/ID optimization methodology and by lowering the supply voltage. A very small capacitance of about Delta C approximate to 16 aF through a customized lateral metal-oxide-metal capacitor bank is utilized to attain small switchable capacitance in the fine capacitor bank tuning. The parasitic inductance due to routing is eliminated by using an aluminum metal with a very large width. The proposed design is fabricated with 55-nm CMOS process. The experimental results show that the power consumption of the proposed DCO including both LDO and bandgap voltage reference is 260 mu W with the supply voltage of 0.55 V, and the constant current consumption is 480 mu A over PVT variations. The tuning range of 2.23 similar to 2.7 GHz and frequency resolution of 2.44 kHz are achieved. At 1-MHz offset frequency from the carrier frequency of 2.44 GHz, the DCO phase noise and the figure of merit (FOMT) considering the frequency tuning range are -119.05 and 199.12 dBc/Hz, respectively.

It aims at direct powering by the sub-0.5-V energy-harvesting sources like the on-body thermoelectric, eliminating the loss and cost of the interim dc-dc converters. Specifically, the RX incorporates: 1) a two-stage power-gating low-noise amplifier with fully on-chip input-impedance matching and passive gain boosting reducing both the active and sleep power; 2) a class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in parallel with a class-C starter to secure a fast startup; and 3) a mu PM using ring-VCO-locked charge pumps and bandgap references to withstand the supply-voltage variation (0.18-0.3 V).

However, no definitive solution for achieving a low-cost and accurate positioning system has been found. In most traditional approaches, solving the indoor localization problem requires the availability of a large number of labeled training samples, the collection of which requires considerable manual effort. Previous research has not provided a means of simultaneously reducing human calibration effort and improving location accuracy. This paper introduces fusion semi-supervised extreme learning machine (FSELM), a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the fusion of information from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. Unlike previous semi-supervised methods, which consider multiple signals individually, FSELM fuses multiple signals into a unified model. When applied to sparsely calibrated localization problems, our proposed method is advantageous in three respects. First, it can dramatically reduce the human calibration effort required when using a semi-supervised learning framework. Second, it utilizes fused Wi-Fi and BLE fingerprints to markedly improve the location accuracy. Third, it inherits the beneficial properties of ELMs with regard to training and testing speeds because the input weights and biases of hidden nodes can be generated randomly. As demonstrated by experimental results obtained on practical indoor localization datasets, FSELM possesses a better semi-supervised manifold learning ability and achieves higher location accuracy than several previous batch supervised learning approaches (ELM, BP and SVM) and semi-supervised learning approaches (SELM, S-RVFL and FS-RVFL). Moreover, FSELM needs less training and testing time, making it easier to apply in practice. We conclude through experiments that FSELM yields good results when applied to a multi-signal-based semi-supervised learning problem. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: First, the findings indicate that effective multi-data fusion can be achieved not only through data-layer fusion, feature-layer fusion and decision-layer fusion but also through the fusion of constraints within a model. Second, for semi-supervised learning problems, it is necessary to combine the advantages of different types of data by optimizing the model's parameters.

J	Ng, PC; She, J; Park, S				Ng, Pai Chet; She, James; Park, Soochang			High Resolution Beacon-Based Proximity Detection for Dense Deployment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Proximity detection; bluetooth low energy beacon; proximity-based services; deployment density	DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; BLUETOOTH; LOCALIZATION; LOCATION; OPTIMIZATION; INTERNET; PEOPLE; ENERGY; SYSTEM	The emergence of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons has promoted the development of proximity-based service (PBS), which is a context-aware application delivered subject to the Proximity of Interest (Pol). Most commercial applications use the sequential proximity detection with a fixed scanning mechanism to identify the target Pol. Such sequential execution, though is able to produce reliable detection, suffers severe performance degradation especially when the number of deployed beacons in the vicinity increases. To understand the effects of dense deployment, we conduct an empirical investigation and derive the statistical properties of both received signal strength (RSS) and signal inter-arrival time. In light of the statistical insights, this paper proposes a high resolution proximity detection using an adaptive scanning mechanism fusion with a spontaneous Differential Evolution (AS+sDE). This novel approach enables the receiver to adapt its scanning duration conditioned on the deployment density and make an almost spontaneous detection in parallel with the scanning. The feasibility of the proposed approach is verified by both simulations and real-world implementations. For a density of <= 5 beacons/m(2), AS+sDE achieves a superior performance with a high accuracy rate, i.e., on average < 1 s is spent to guarantee at least 90 percent accuracy.

Open-Source Potentiostat for Wireless Electrochemical Detection with Smartphones	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-SITU; SENSORS; BIOSENSORS; PLATFORM; HEALTH; DNA	This paper describes the design and characterization of an open-source "universal wireless electrochemical detector" (UWED). This detector interfaces with a smartphone (or a tablet) using "Bluetooth Low Energy" protocol; the smartphone provides (i) a user interface for receiving the experimental parameters from the user and visualizing the result in real time, and (ii) a proxy for storing, processing, and transmitting the data and experimental protocols. This approach simplifies the design, and decreases both the size and the cost of the hardware; it also makes the UWED adaptable to different types of analyses by simple modification of the software. The UWED can perform the most common electroanalytical techniques of potentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry, with results closely comparable to benchtop commercial potentiostats. Although the operating ranges of electrical current and voltage of the UWED (+/- 1.5 V, +/- 180 mu A) are more limited than most benchtop commercial potentiostats, its functional range is sufficient for most electrochemical analyses in aqueous solutions. Because the UWED is simple, small in size, assembled from inexpensive components, and completely wireless, it offers new opportunities for the development of affordable diagnostics, sensors, and wearable devices.

J	Lin, YW; Lin, CY				Lin, You-Wei; Lin, Chi-Yi			An Interactive Real-Time Locating System Based on Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacon Network	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; location-based service; mesh network; internet of things		The ubiquity of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and peripherals has brought tremendous convenience to our daily life. In recent years, Bluetooth beacons have also been gaining popularity in implementing a variety of innovative location-based services such as self-guided systems in exhibition centers. However, the broadcast-based beacon technology can only provide unidirectional communication. In case smartphone users would like to respond to the beacon messages, they have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. Nevertheless, mobile Internet services may not be always available or too costly. In this work, we develop a real-time locating system based only on the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to support interactive communications by combining the broadcast and mesh topology options to extend the applicability of beacon solutions. Specifically, we turn the smartphone into a beacon device and augment the beacon devices with the capability of forming a mesh network. The implementation result shows that our beacon devices can detect the presence of specific users at specific locations, and then the presence state can be sent to the application server via the relay of beacon devices. Moreover, the application server can send personalized location-based messages to the users, again via the relay of beacon devices. With the capability of relaying messages between the beacon devices, it would be convenient for developers to implement a variety of interactive applications such as tracking VIP customers at the airport, or tracking an elder with Alzheimer's disease in the neighborhood.

J	Wang, SS				Wang, Sheng-Shih			A BLE-Based Pedestrian Navigation System for Car Searching in Indoor Parking Garages	SENSORS			English	Article						positioning; navigation; car-searching; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)	LOCALIZATION	The continuous global increase in the number of cars has led to an increase in parking issues, particularly with respect to the search for available parking spaces and finding cars. In this paper, we propose a navigation system for car owners to find their cars in indoor parking garages. The proposed system comprises a car-searching mobile app and a positioning-assisting subsystem. The app guides car owners to their cars based on a "turn-by-turn" navigation strategy, and has the ability to correct the user's heading orientation. The subsystem uses beacon technology for indoor positioning, supporting self-guidance of the car-searching mobile app. This study also designed a local coordinate system to support the identification of the locations of parking spaces and beacon devices. We used Android as the platform to implement the proposed car-searching mobile app, and used Bytereal HiBeacon devices to implement the proposed positioning-assisting subsystem. We also deployed the system in a parking lot in our campus for testing. The experimental results verified that the proposed system not only works well, but also provides the car owner with the correct route guidance information.

The receiver is fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology and operates in the ISM band of 902-928 MHz. Binary search algorithm through successive approximation register architecture is being exploited to calibrate the internally generated quench signal and the working frequency of the receiver. Employing an on-chip inductor and a single ended to differential architecture for the input amplifier has made the receiver fully integrable, eliminating the need for external components. A power consumption of 320 mu W from a 0.65-V supply results in an excellent energy efficiency of 80 pJ/b at 4-Mb/s data rate ( DR). The receiver also employs an analog to digital converter that enables soft-decisioning and a convenient sensitivity-DR tradeoff, achieving sensitivity of -86.5, and -101.5 dBm at 1000-and 31.25-kbps DR, respectively.

The antenna was built on a flexible and thin Kapton material inserted between 2 layers of bovine leather, suitable for limited weight and slim ankle bracelet designs. Proposed antenna structure consist of 2 opposed planar inverted F antennas modified using matching stubs, sharing the same substrate and ground plane, with total size of 96.8 x 35 x 4.14 mm. The ground plane area of the antenna can be used for electronic circuit and battery placement. The antenna structure operates in the following specific 4 bands: BeiDou (1561 MHz), GPS (1575 MHz), GLONASS (1602 MHz), and BLE (2400 MHz). The antenna exhibited great agreement between electromagnetic simulations in ADS Momentum and measurements performed into 3D anechoic chamber with anthropomorphic leg-foot model from Speag. The antenna peak gain is approximately -1.8 dBi for GNSS bands and -2.0 dBi for BLE.

J	Yohan, A; Lo, NW; Winata, D				Yohan, Alexander; Lo, Nai-Wei; Winata, Doni			An Indoor Positioning-Based Mobile Payment System Using Bluetooth Low Energy Technology	SENSORS			English	Article						mutual authentication; Bluetooth beacon; Bluetooth Low Energy; indoor positioning service; mobile payment	TRIANGULATION; LOCALIZATION; BEACONS	The development of information technology has paved the way for faster and more convenient payment process flows and new methodology for the design and implementation of next generation payment systems. The growth of smartphone usage nowadays has fostered a new and popular mobile payment environment. Most of the current generation smartphones support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate with nearby BLE-enabled devices. It is plausible to construct an Over-the-Air BLE-based mobile payment system as one of the payment methods for people living in modern societies. In this paper, a secure indoor positioning-based mobile payment authentication protocol with BLE technology and the corresponding mobile payment system design are proposed. The proposed protocol consists of three phases: initialization phase, session key construction phase, and authentication phase. When a customer moves toward the POS counter area, the proposed mobile payment system will automatically detect the position of the customer to confirm whether the customer is ready for the checkout process. Once the system has identified the customer is standing within the payment-enabled area, the payment system will invoke authentication process between POS and the customer's smartphone through BLE communication channel to generate a secure session key and establish an authenticated communication session to perform the payment transaction accordingly. A prototype is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed design for mobile payment system. In addition, security analysis is conducted to evaluate the security strength of the proposed protocol.

This novel solution is based on the Bluetooth protocol called FatBeacon, created by Google, which can be used in places such as subway stations located below ground, outdoor areas where even 2G coverage is unreachable or simply as an alternative to current technologies that may require an additional cost, such as the Internet in some countries. In particular, this work describes a new solution for supporting tourism called Smart Tourism for which an interactive and non-intrusive guidance application based on the FatBeacon protocol is presented. The developed application informs the users about the way to reach their destination without getting lost and can be used to obtain user data tracking anonymously. In this way, the cooperation between the different systems and components of the scheme creates a distributed ecosystem that is independent of an Internet connection. Since no FatBeacon implementations can be found yet, an experimental implementation was developed to test the proposal, and the obtained results are promising.

Providing a large amount of training data is not always feasible; therefore, we need to consider alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training purposes. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised DRL model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning agent. The model utilizes variational autoencoders as the inference engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first investigation that extends DRL to the semisupervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the problem of indoor localization based on Bluetooth low energy signal strength. Indoor localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more received rewards compared to the supervised DRL model.

Low power wireless devices are, undoubtedly, the most viable solution for diverse IoT use cases. Among such devices, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons have emerged as one of the most promising due to the ubiquity of Bluetooth-compatible devices, such as iPhones and Android smartphones. However, for BLE beacons to continue penetrating the IoT ecosystem in a holistic manner, interdisciplinary research is needed to ensure seamless integration. This paper consolidates the information on the state-of-the-art BLE beacon, from its application and deployment cases, hardware requirements, and casing design to its software and protocol design, and it delivers a timely review of the related research challenges. In particular, the BLE beacon's cutting-edge applications, the interoperability between packet profiles, the reliability of its signal detection and distance estimation methods, the sustainability of its low energy, and its deployment constraints are discussed to identify research opportunities and directions.

J	Spachos, P; Mackey, A				Spachos, Petros; Mackey, Andrew			Energy efficiency and accuracy of solar powered BLE beacons	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Solar powered BLE beacons; Energy efficiency; Accuracy; Internet of Things	WIRELESS; ARCHITECTURE; INFORMATION; INTERNET; THINGS; IOT	In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in the numbers of wireless devices which connect to the Internet. At the same time, the networks size have grown larger than ever before. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are an attractive solution for a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from micro localization to advertisement and transportation. BLE beacons are small, low cost devices that are capable of providing contextual and locational information to the users. In the fifth generation (5G) ecosystem, many BLE beacons are expected to be deployed among other devices. In 5G wireless networks era, sustainable and energy aware networks are vital to usability and performance. An appealing solution for energy efficiency is energy harvesting for wireless devices. To reduce the maintenance and increase the lifespan of networks that include such devices, solar powered beacons can be used. In this paper, the performance of solar powered BLE beacons is examined in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy.

Compared to classic Bluetooth, BLE has been simplified in many ways that include its connection establishment, data exchange, and encryption processes. Unfortunately, this simplification comes at a cost. For example, only a star topology is supported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with only one gateway (e.g., a smartphone, or a BLE hub) at any given set time. When a peripheral goes out of range and thus loses connectivity to a gateway, it cannot connect and seamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions. In other words, BLE connections are not automatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway. In this paper, we propose SeamBlue(1), which brings secure seamless connectivity to BLE-capable mobile IoT devices in an environment that consists of a network of gateways. Our framework ensures that unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf BLE devices seamlessly and securely connect to a nearby gateway without any user intervention.

One of the main challenges that exists with these platforms in multi-residential houses is activity labeling. As most of the activity sensors do not provide any information regarding the identity of the person who triggers them, it is difficult to label the sensor events in multi-residential smart homes. To deal with this challenge, individual localization in different areas can be a promising solution. The localization information can be used to automatically label the activity sensor data to individuals. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology for this application due to how easy it is to implement and its low energy footprint. In this approach, individuals wear a tag that broadcasts its unique identity (ID) in certain time intervals, while fixed scanners listen to the broadcasting packet to localize the tag and the individual. However, the localization accuracy of this method depends greatly on different settings of broadcasting signal strength, and the time interval of BLE tags. To achieve the best localization accuracy, this paper studies the impacts of different advertising time intervals and power levels, and proposes an efficient and applicable algorithm to select optimal value settings of BLE sensors. Moreover, it proposes an automatic activity labeling method, through integrating BLE localization information and ambient sensor data. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed structure is also demonstrated in a real multi-resident smart home scenario.

Athletes' times are calculated via passive RFID tags and reader kits. Specifically, the reader infrastructure needed is complex and requires the deployment of a mat or ramps which hide the receiver antennae under them. Moreover, with the employed tags, it is not possible to transmit additional and dynamic information such as pulse or oximetry monitoring, alarms, etc. In this paper we present a system based on two low complex schemes allowed in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): the non-connectable undirected advertisement process and a modified version of scannable undirected advertisement process using the new capabilities present in Bluetooth 5. After fully describing the system architecture, which allows full real-time position monitoring of the runners using mobile phones on the organizer side and BLE sensors on the participants' side, we derive the mobility patterns of runners and capacity requirements, which are determinant for evaluating the performance of the proposed system. They have been obtained from the analysis of the real data measured in the last Barcelona Marathon. By means of simulations, we demonstrate that, even under disadvantageous conditions (50% error ratio), both schemes perform reliably and are able to detect the 100% of the participants in all the cases. The cell coverage of the system needs to be adjusted when non-connectable process is considered. Nevertheless, through simulation and experimental, we show that the proposed scheme based on the new events available in Bluetooth 5 is clearly the best implementation alternative for all the cases, no matter the coverage area and the runner speed. The proposal widely exceeds the detection requirements of the real scenario, surpassing the measured peaks of 20 sensors per second incoming in the coverage area, moving at speeds that range from 1.5 m/s to 6.25 m/s. The designed real test-bed shows that the scheme is able to detect 72 sensors below 600 ms, fulfilling comfortably the requirements determined for the intended application. The main disadvantage of this system would be that the sensors are active, but we have proved that its consumption can be so low (9.5 mu A) that, with a typical button cell, the sensor battery life would be over 10,000 h of use.

Among the central elements of such a state is the presence of humans and their number. For a smart office building, such information can be used for saving energy and safety purposes. While acquiring presence information is crucial, using sensing techniques that are highly intrusive, such as cameras, is often not acceptable for the building occupants. In this paper, we illustrate a proposal for occupancy detection which is low intrusive; it is based on equipment typically available in modern offices such as room-level power-metering and an app running on workers' mobile phones. For power metering, we collect the aggregated power consumption and disaggregate the load of each device. For the mobile phone, we use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) nodes deployed around workspaces to localize the phone in a room. We test the system in our offices. The experiments show that sensor fusion of the two sensing modalities gives 87-90% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	Wang, Y; Li, X; Zou, JH				Wang, Yan; Li, Xin; Zou, Jiaheng			A Foot-Mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Positioning Algorithm Based on Magnetic Constraint	SENSORS			English	Article						FFT; magnetic field; graph optimization; foot-mounted IMU	FUSION	With the development of related applications, indoor positioning techniques have been more and more widely developed. Based on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and geomagnetism, indoor positioning techniques often rely on the physical location of fingerprint information. The focus and difficulty of establishing the fingerprint database are in obtaining a relatively accurate physical location with as little given information as possible. This paper presents a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) positioning algorithm under the loop closure constraint based on magnetic information. It can provide relatively reliable position information without maps and geomagnetic information and provides a relatively accurate coordinate for the collection of a fingerprint database. In the experiment, the features extracted by the multi-level Fourier transform method proposed in this paper are validated and the validity of loop closure matching is tested with a RANSAC-based method. Moreover, the loop closure detection results show that the cumulative error of the trajectory processed by the graph optimization algorithm is significantly suppressed, presenting a good accuracy. The average error of the trajectory under loop closure constraint is controlled below 2.15 m.

J	Kitazato, T; Hoshino, M; Ito, M; Sezaki, K				Kitazato, Tomoya; Hoshino, Miku; Ito, Masaki; Sezaki, Kaoru			Detection of Pedestrian Flow Using Mobile Devices for Evacuation Guiding in Disaster	JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH			English	Article						crowd sensing; evacuation guidance; mobile sensing	SYSTEM	In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred, killing approximately 20,000 people. Previous research has shown that evacuation start time and evacuation behavior are related to the disaster survival rate: immediate evacuation increases the survival rate and evacuation-disruption caused by traffic congestion decreases it. Therefore, it can be assumed that guiding people to safe locations will increase the survival rate. The detection of the human mobility flow is a key to rescuing more people, because its analysis can help determine the appropriate evacuation routes toward which people should be guided. The objective of our research is to develop a system for detecting the human mobility flows in a disaster scenario. We analyzed the requirements of human mobility flow detection for disaster evacuation guidance. In this paper, we propose a crowd sensing system that uses Bluetooth for recognizing human mobility flows. By detecting Bluetooth devices carried by pedestrians, the congestion degree can be estimated. Further, the devices' movements can be detected by observing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) beacons carried by pedestrians. The results of experimental evaluations of these two methods verify their usefulness. Our methods can estimate the congestion degree, as well as the velocity of walking pedestrians.

To improve the linearity and reduce the switching power consumption, a segmented structure with new switching scheme is adopted in the capacitive digital-to-analog converter. The proposed switching sequence determines the MSBs according to the thermometer codes and skips some of the unnecessary steps while avoiding bubble errors. To ensure the common mode voltage remains comparatively steady, and to avoid employing power-hungry common mode reference voltage circuits, each capacitor is divided into 2 identical small capacitors, connecting one of them to high and the other one to low. The switching sequence is straightforward, and a split capacitor with an integer value is applied, which almost halves the total number of capacitors while retaining the unit capacitor value intact. The prototype analog-to-digital converter is fabricated and measured in a 55-nm (shrinked 65nm) complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process and achieves 5.48 to 5.92 Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) at a sampling frequency of 4MS/s. The Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) and Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) for Nyquist input frequency are 34.79 and 40.03dB, respectively. The current consumption is 4.8A from a 1.0-V supply, which corresponds to the figure of merit of 26fJ/conversion-step. The total active area of the analog-to-digital converters for the I and Q paths of the receiver is 105 mu mx140 mu m.

J	Seong, JH; Seo, DH				Seong, Ju-Hyeon; Seo, Dong-Hoan			Environment Adaptive Localization Method Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wi-Fi; BLE; Fingerprint; Database; Log-distance path loss model	POSITIONING SYSTEMS; INDOOR; SEARCH; SENSOR	Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting techniques for indoor positioning can be readily implemented via a wireless access point. These methods have therefore been widely studied in the field of positioning. However, fingerprinting suffers low accuracy of positioning on account of high noise occurrences which are caused by other wireless communication signals and environmental factors when the RSSI is received, and by relatively high errors on account of low position resolution compared to other methods such as time of flight and inertial navigation technology. In this paper, a modified fingerprint algorithm based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy applied to the log-distance path loss model is proposed to remove unnecessary Wi-Fi data, and produce the AP database that can be updated depending on the changes of the ambient environment as the indoor area is increasingly complicated and extended. Instead of using the existing fingerprinting techniques of consulting signal strengths as factors that are stored in a database, the proposed algorithm employs environmental variables to which the log-distance path loss model is applied. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has higher position resolution than existing fingerprint and can improve the accuracy of positioning because of its low dependence on reference points. To minimize database and eliminate inaccurate AP signals, the Hausdorff distance algorithm and median filter are applied. Using a database in which environment variables are stored, the results are inversely transformed into the log-distance path loss model for expression as coordinates. The proposed algorithm was compared with existing fingerprinting methods. The experimental results demonstrated the reduction of positioning improvement by 0.695 m from 2.758 to 2.063 m.

This paper describes an alternative method to detect sleep parameters by measuring a variation in the earth's magnetic field. A magnetometer sensor, laid onto the body, detects millimeter night-time breathing movements by measuring the change in the magnetic vectors. A soft, noninvasive wearable sensor is designed to be printed on a miniature printed circuit board, packaged in a minimal invasive board, which includes a wireless Bluetooth low-energy (BIT) module and a low-power microcontroller. A very low power consumption is achieved by applying a smart processing algorithm, which is also described. The algorithm delivers respiration rate, apnoea time, and time in movement. A comparison with a well-known air-flow sensor is also discussed.

J	Meliones, A; Sampson, D				Meliones, Apostolos; Sampson, Demetrios			Blind MuseumTourer: A System for Self-Guided Tours in Museums and Blind Indoor Navigation	TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						blind indoor navigation; blind and visually impaired; assistive application; indoor positioning system; Android; smartphone navigation; Tactual Museum; blind accessibility	PEOPLE	Notably valuable efforts have focused on helping people with special needs. In this work, we build upon the experience from the BlindHelper smartphone outdoor pedestrian navigation app and present Blind MuseumTourer, a system for indoor interactive autonomous navigation for blind and visually impaired persons and groups (e.g., pupils), which has primarily addressed blind or visually impaired (BVI) accessibility and self-guided tours in museums. A pilot prototype has been developed and is currently under evaluation at the Tactual Museum with the collaboration of the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece. This paper describes the functionality of the application and evaluates candidate indoor location determination technologies, such as wireless local area network (WLAN) and surface-mounted assistive tactile route indications combined with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and inertial dead-reckoning functionality, to come up with a reliable and highly accurate indoor positioning system adopting the latter solution. The developed concepts, including map matching, a key concept for indoor navigation, apply in a similar way to other indoor guidance use cases involving complex indoor places, such as in hospitals, shopping malls, airports, train stations, public and municipality buildings, office buildings, university buildings, hotel resorts, passenger ships, etc. The presented Android application is effectively a Blind IndoorGuide system for accurate and reliable blind indoor navigation.

J	Kindt, PH; Saur, M; Balszun, M; Chakraborty, S				Kindt, Philipp H.; Saur, Marco; Balszun, Michael; Chakraborty, Samarjit			Neighbor Discovery Latency in BLE-Like Protocols	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; ANT; neighbor discovery; MANETS	LOW-ENERGY NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; DEVICE DISCOVERY	Neighbor discovery is the procedure in which two wireless devices initiate a first contact. In low power ad-hoc networks, radios are duty-cycled and the latency until a packet meets a reception phase of another device is determined by a random process. Most research considers slotted protocols, in which the points in time for reception are temporally coupled to beacon transmissions. In contrast, many recent protocols, such as ANT/ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) use a slotless, periodic-interval based scheme for neighbor discovery. Here, one device periodically broadcasts packets, whereas the other device periodically listens to the channel. Both periods are independent from each other and drawn over continuous time. Such protocols provide 3 degrees of freedom (viz., the intervals for advertising and scanning and the duration of each scan phase). Though billions of existing BLE devices rely on these protocols, neither their expected latencies nor beneficial configurations with good latency-duty-cycle relations are known. Parametrizations for the participating devices are usually determined based on a "good guess". In this paper, we, for the first time, present a mathematical theory which can compute the neighbor discovery latencies for all possible parametrizations. Further, our theory shows that upper bounds on the latency can be guaranteed for all parametrizations, except for a finite number of singularities. Therefore, slotless, periodic interval-based protocols can be used in applications with deterministic latency demands, which have been reserved for slotted protocols until now. Our proposed theory can be used for analyzing the neighbor discovery latencies, for tweaking protocol parameters and for developing new protocols.

The IC is composed of a 3-10 Mb/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)/offset QPSK (OQPSK) TRX working at the 400-500 MHz band, and a 1-3 Mb/s Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK)/half sine OQPSK (HS-OQPSK) TRX at the 2.4-2.4835 GHz band for the Bluetooth low energy/IEEE 802.15.4 protocols. The presented combo TRX IC requires one single antenna without any bidirectional RF coupler, to support simultaneous dual-band communication. Two key circuit techniques, namely, the combination biasing technique to suppress the high-order harmonics and the active in-band interference cancellation, are adopted to tackle the crosstalk interference between the two bands during simultaneous dual-band operation. Measurement results show that the in-band interference presented to the 2.4-GHz receiver due to the 400-MHz transmitter is suppressed by 19 dB with the presented design techniques.

A low-power local processor is proposed, which can perform signal processing to convert raw magnetic sensor signals to user-defined commands, on the sTDS wearable headset, rather than sending all raw data out to a PC or smartphone. The proposed sTDS significantly reduces the transmitter power consumption and subsequently increases the battery life. Assuming the sTDS user issues one command every 20 ms, the proposed local processor reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted by a factor of 64, from 9.6 to 0.15 kb/s. The proposed processor consists of three main blocks: serial peripheral interface bus for receiving raw data from magnetic sensors, external magnetic interference attenuation to attenuate external magnetic field from the raw magnetic signal, and a machine learning classifier for command detection. A proof-of-concept prototype sTDS has been implemented with a low-power IGLOO-nano field programmable gate array (FPGA), bluetooth low energy, battery and magnetic sensors on a headset, and tested. At clock frequency of 20 MHz, the processor takes 6.6 mu s and consumes 27 nJ for detecting a command with a detection accuracy of 96.9%. To further reduce power consumption, an application-specified integrated circuit processor for the sTDS is implemented at the postlayout level in 65-nm CMOS technology with 1-V power supply, and it consumes 0.43 mW, which is 10x lower than FPGA power consumption and occupies an area of only 0.016 mm(2)	[Jafari, Ali; Buswell, Nathanael; Mohsenin, Tinoosh] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Comp Sci & Elect Engn Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Ghovanloo, Maysam] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA	Jafari, A (reprint author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Comp Sci & Elect Engn Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.	a137@umbc.edu; nat6@umbc.edu; mgh@gatech.edu; tinoosh@umbc.edu		Ghovanloo, Maysam/0000-0001-9502-3704	National Science Foundation [00010145]	This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant 00010145.

J	Lee, BG; Lee, SM				Lee, Boon Giin; Lee, Su Min			Smart Wearable Hand Device for Sign Language Interpretation System With Sensors Fusion	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Gesture recognition; machine learning; mobile application; sign language recognition; wearable computing	GESTURE RECOGNITION; GLOVE	Gesturing is an instinctive way of communicating to present a specific meaning or intent. Therefore, research into sign language interpretation using gestures has been explored progressively during recent decades to serve as an auxiliary tool for deaf and mute people to blend into society without barriers. In this paper, a smart sign language interpretation system using a wearable hand device is proposed to meet this purpose. This wearable system utilizes five flex-sensors, two pressure sensors, and a three-axis inertial motion sensor to distinguish the characters in the American sign language alphabet. The entire system mainly consists of three modules: 1) a wearable device with a sensor module; 2) a processing module; and 3) a display unit mobile application module. Sensor data are collected and analyzed using a built-in embedded support vector machine classifier. Subsequently, the recognized alphabet is further transmitted to a mobile device through Bluetooth low energy wireless communication. An Android-based mobile application was developed with a text-to-speech function that converts the received textinto audible voice output. Experiment results indicate that a true sign language recognition accuracy rate of 65.7% can be achieved on average in the first version without pressure sensors. A second version of the proposed wearable system with the fusion of pressure sensors on the middle finger increased the recognition accuracy rate dramatically to 98.2%. The proposed wearable system outperforms the existing method, for instance, although background lights, and other factors are crucial to a vision-based processing method, they are not for the proposed system.

J	Li, G; Chung, WY				Li, Gang; Chung, Wan-Young			Combined EEG-Gyroscope-tDCS Brain Machine Interface System for Early Management of Driver Drowsiness	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Closed-loop algorithm; driver drowsiness detection (DDD); electroencephalogram (EEG); motion capture; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)	CURRENT STIMULATION TDCS; COMPUTER-INTERFACE; VIGILANCE; WIRELESS; SIGNALS	In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a wireless, wearable brain machine interface (BMI) system dedicated to signal sensing and processing for driver drowsiness detection (DDD). Owing to the importance of driver drowsiness and the possibility for brainwaves-based DDD, many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based approaches have been proposed. However, few studies focus on the early detection of driver drowsiness and on the early management of driver drowsiness using a closed-loop algorithm. The reported wireless and wearable BMI system is used for 1) simultaneous EEG and gyroscope-based head movement measurement for the early detection of driver drowsiness and 2) simultaneous EEG and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the early management of driver drowsiness. To achieve the purposes of easy-to-use and distraction-free driving, a Bluetooth low-energy module is embedded in this BMI system and used to communicate with a fully wearable consumer device, a smartwatch, which coordinates the work of drowsiness monitoring and brain stimulation with its embedded closed-loop algorithm. The proposed system offers a 128 Hz sampling rate per channel, 12-bit and 16-bit resolution for a single-channel EEG and a three-channel gyroscope, and a maximum 2 mA current for the tDCS. The current consumption of the whole headset system is 56 mA. The battery life of the smartwatch is 9 h. The DDD experimental results show that the proposed system obtained a 93.67% five-level overall accuracy, a 96.15% two-level (alert versus slightly drowsy) accuracy, and maximum 16- to 23-min wakefulness maintenance.

J	Chen, JH; Chen, YS; Jiang, YL				Chen, Jing-Ho; Chen, Ya-Shu; Jiang, Yu-Lin			Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Multiple Latency-Sensitive Bluetooth Low Energy Nodes	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Energy-efficient scheduling; real-time scheduling; Bluetooth low energy	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; DEVICE DISCOVERY	Energy-efficient scheduling in wireless embedded devices is a critical consideration due to limited energy supplies and the latency constraint of sensory data processing. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a low power solution that provides a user-defined connection interval parameter for extending the sleep time of BLE nodes. Instead of minimizing the values for this connection parameter to minimize latency, which can lead to excessive energy consumption, this paper presents a practical energy-efficient scheduling framework for multiple BLE devices having applications with latency constraints. First, we determine the required connection interval for a single BLE node with multi-rate sensing applications. Then, considering the scheduling issues caused by non-preemptive data transmission, we present an energy-efficient connection interval assignment for a sensor network with multiple BLE nodes to meet the latency constraints of sensing applications. Finally, based on the proposed connection interval determination, we propose a priority inversion awareness scheduler for the BLE master node to schedule all slave node transmissions in the network. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms prolonged network lifetime by 235% compared with a simple pessimistic setting.

The RSSI-based positioning is roughly classified into two types: user navigation and monitoring. Our target is the user monitoring scenario by using commercially available BLE dongles, which are compact, inexpensive, and low power consumptions. In this case, the user device sends beacon signals to a large number of receivers in the room. Due to the insufficient BLE transceiver for the accurate positioning, sophisticated support vector machine (SVM)-aided machine learning algorithm plays a vital role in dealing with impairments induced by BLE. Furthermore, according to contiguous movements of the object, prior information of the positioning can be yielded for improving the object tracking capability. Finally, Kalman filter is applied to smooth the tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

In this context, we investigate the latest improvements with Bluetooth 5.0 especially with regards its range when the signal penetrates through different types of multiple partitions. The improvements in Bluetooth technology especially with regards form factor, low energy consumption, and higher speeds make this a viable technology for use in indoor RTLS. Several different venues are used at the University to mimic the Healthcare environment to conduct the experiment. The results indicated an acceptable range through obstacles such glass, drywall partitions and solid brick wall.

Indoors, self-location estimation can be performed by wireless LAN or beacon. However, for self-driving, more accurate position estimation is required. In previous research on self-driving of electric wheelchairs, there are methods using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and laser range scanner. However, the conventional research has a problem that the system configuration is complicated and the power consumption also increases. In this study, we developed position estimation by deep learning using smartphone images with a positioning accuracy that allowed self-driving at low cost. Also, when the smartphone image recognition does not work, such as when the wheelchair approaches a wall, position estimation by augmented reality (AR) markers was used. In addition, a Bluetooth low-energy beacon was used to approximate the position when no marker could be seen. The route from an initial position to a destination was calculated using map information stored within the system. Experiments confirmed that the proposed system allows self-driving of an electric wheelchair along the route from its initial position to a destination. In this prototype system, we used the GPU board to calculate deep learning, but in the future we plan to concentrate the system on smart phones by calculating with the AI chip embedded in the smartphone.

As an example, it has been a challenge to accurately evaluate postoperative mobility in patient care units. This paper describes the development and implementation of a proof-of-concept, a low cost and easily deployable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based localization system used to identify and locate patients. Using the received signal strength (RSS) of BLE signal and the uniqueness of BLE hardware addresses, patients can be identified and located within the hospital room. The value of RSS of BLE signal from wearable BLE beacon varies with distance to the wall anchored BLE scanner. The first part of the paper presents the results of the experiments conducted in a low noise and non-reflective environment. The second half of the paper talks about the proposed algorithm of localization of the subject within the experimental room. The paper evaluates the effects of the number of BLE wall anchored scanners and the number of packets on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated to have better performance than other classical approaches.

In this article, we present our proposal - PrecaElevator, a novel elevator system in smart building that enables passengers to reduce their waiting time through pre-registering elevator calls. After upgraded a traditional elevator to Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled and transferred the real-time computational capability to the agent server, the elevator was upgraded as a smart object computing on context awareness in both elevator and passengers. By leveraging BLE-based localization of the passenger, PrecaElevator enables the passenger to pre-register elevator call if his/her location was detected within the callable range for elevator control. We have experimented the proposed system in the real smart building environment. The simulations based on the calculated waiting time from elevator historical records showed the effectiveness of waiting time reduction.

The RSSI emmitted from the IoT are converted into the relative distance between the IoT nodes to determine the current location. In order to enhance the accuracy, the area of interest is further divided into few zones. The RSSI from the nearby IoT devices (BLE Beacons) detected in each zones are collected. This enable the system to first identify the correct zone located, and utilizing the relative distance from the RSSI at the zone to further acquire the current position inside the zone. A demo system has been developed with the Bluetoothe Low Energy (BLE) to evaluate the indoor localization service with this zone system.

Typical IoT application architecture consists of the cloud and the edge nodes. For cloud computing, resource-rich environment allows the use of powerful CPUs. On the other hand, edge nodes need to be lightweight to operate in resource-poor environment so that we can connect many objects in our surrounding to the cloud. Thus, the CPUs for edge nodes arc often not so powerful. Due the scarce resources, the system software for edge nodes must be lightweight (e.g., small memory footprint, low-power consumption, etc.). It also needs talk to the cloud using appropriate low-power network protocol stack such as Bluetooth Low Energy, 6LoWPAN, etc., and often needs to response to external stimuli in a real-time fashion. TRON Project, under the leadership of Ken Sakamura, has tackled the needs for such embedded computers by providing a series of TRON real-time OSs (RTOSs) since its inception in 1984. The TRON RTOS family has enjoyed the use by many users and in variety of applications: control modules of Japanese space satellite, consumer electronics goods such as digital cameras, printers, copiers, mobile phones (its RF module control), automobile engine control, etc. The TRON RTOS family specifications have become the de facto standards of RTOS in Japan and beyond. In August 2017, TRON Forum, an not-for-profit organization that promotes the activity of TRON Project, signed an agreement with IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) to share the copyright of the specification of mu T-Kernel 2.0, the latest member of TRON RTOS family, for the explicit purpose of turning the specification into an IEEE standard. An IEEE SA working group, WG 2050, was formed in late 2017 for the standardization work. Mr. Stephen Dukes of IEEE Consumer Electronics Society chaired the WC,. The WG membership consisted of stakeholders in consumer electronics industry. Thanks to the diligence of WG 2050, IEEE Std 2050-2018 based on the original mu T-Kernel 2.0 specification became an official IEEE standard in July 2018 in a record-breaking short time for such a document to become an IEEE standard. IEEE has already produced the famous POSIX standard for UNIX-like operating systems that can be used on the resource-rich cloud side. VT-Kernel 2.0 is meant to be the OS for the resource-poor edge node side. It is hoped that IEEE Std 2050-2018 will popularize and encourage the use of mu T-Kernel 2.0 by many engineers all over the world.

The method estimates the distance between the BLE transmitter and the handset by two different ways, i.e. the first one uses the pathloss-distance relationship, and the second one uses the Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) relying on accelerometers built in the handset. The location is jointly estimated by using both results. Experimental results show that the localization error of the proposed method was 1.14 m on average, which is 2.16 m smaller than that of the method using only pathloss-distance relationship.

This information helps to reduce the time spent waiting by balancing people amongst multiple lines or aids in the decision making about opening a new line. However, current queueing systems are often mounted at fixed positions, require user participation, or need time consuming manual calibration after each layout change. In this work, we introduce CutiQueue, a flexible and portable queueing system that is battery powered, needs no manual calibration or user participation. CutiQueue is based on passive presence detection using the RSSI of low cost Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers. We analyze the performance of the system in experiments using a prototype implementation to estimate the number of people waiting as well as the length of the line. The experimental evaluation indicates an average accuracy of 97.96% when compared to counting people walking or standing in the waiting line using a laser barrier.

In order to enable the management (actuation and control) of equipment via BLE, each BLE network address must be linked with the physical location of equipment. However, the manual location identification effort is labour-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce our basic idea to handle this issue and show a preliminary experimental result. The idea is to design semi-automatic position estimation technique by leveraging the change in RSSI of BLE devices during walking. Our method requires only one tester to carry a smartphone and walk around the building to collect the RSSI. We deployed 10 BLE devices to conduct the preliminary experiment in a single room. The result shows that the locations of 80% BLE devices are correctly identified.

New low-cost sensors, which are both cheaper and smaller, but which propose challenges in terms of accuracy, reliability and performance were evaluated. In our work we aim to identify new methods of assessing data quality objectives in reasonable time and costs, while maintaining the accuracy levels of existing methods. Initial assessments of such sensors are presented, especially the measurement reproducibility evaluation between systems which operate in the same environmental conditions.

In this paper, we present a low-cost yet flexible and powerful hardware/ software platform for sensing, computation, and infrastructureless wireless communication. Since energy usage is a key issue for autonomous operation, we investigate the power requirements of various computing platforms, sensors and radio link technologies. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate several license-free radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa 433 MHz and 868 Mhz) in terms of their real-world communication ranges. To avoid wasting precious communication resources, we apply machine learning and imagebased concept detection on-device to remove irrelevant data before sending it. We also evaluate neural compute sticks to improve performance and optimize their power consumption in our scenario. The proposed hardware/ software platform consists of small, low-power sensor nodes based on microcontrollers, larger single board computer relay nodes that can also preprocess data, and Bluetooth Low Energy enabled smartphone add-ons to give mobile devices access to long range communication technology. Finally, a Linux distribution tailored to the specific needs in this application area is presented that makes deploying new relay nodes easy even for non-specialists.

PM2.5, which refers to particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m, is the product of many common combustion reactions and poses a particularly serious health risk. The small size of the particle allows it to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Due to the highly localized nature of air pollution, and to enable individuals and institutions to monitor their real-time exposure to PM2.5 easily, we designed Halo, an air quality monitor costing less than $100. Halo, powered by solar energy, measures reflected IR light to determine the particulate concentration in the air, and it uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate pollution levels to a users phone. From the phone, users can examine personal air quality levels or view aggregated data from multiple devices on a crowd-sourced pollution map. Field test results at Santa Clara University and in a Santa Clara County elementary school demonstrate that Halo can accurately track and measure personal air quality.

It builds on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol and allows devices to extend the range and create a mesh network. BM introduces a publisher/ observer structure where a publisher node can broadcast a packet, known also as an advertisement, and all observers can receive the packet. Typically, in BM networks flooding is used to propagate the advertisements. Flooding is known to suffer from broadcast storm problem and be nonreliable. To improve packet delivery ratio we propose an approach where only a few nodes, relays, are involved in packet forwarding. Selection of the relay nodes, which is a focus of the paper, is a nontrivial task: on the one hand, a minimization of number of relays is desired, on the other hand, using a minimum dominated set would not provide redundancy. We consider three different relay selection mechanisms and develop their extensions that are capable to operate in a distributed fashion. Their performance is evaluated via extensive simulations.

These systems are construct to attain location information of individuals and objects inside a building. Now a day all the applicable wireless technologies used in this context are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based. These advancements are additionally decided for their ease of use, low cost and integration into wireless devices. However, these techniques are having some positioning errors along with specified region. Here, we introduce another wireless technology named Light Fidelity (Li-Fi), the basic convention of this technology is the transfer of information using light illumination by light emitting diodes. This article primarily established a set of evaluation indexes for the performance of these three Wi-Fi, BLE and Li-Fi technologies in indoor positioning scenarios. We compare the predefined IPSs in term of performance and limitations. After then outline the tradeoffs among these systems from the perspective of all evaluation entities. We show experimentally that Li-Fi technology achieves a high efficiency but fur accuracy, Wi-Fi is still better than Li-Fi and BLE technology.

The device placed near a vibrating source can report data to a central device using the embedded Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, or can be included inside a smart network.

Most Dead-Reckoning (DR) systems nowadays available are based on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) operating at a relatively high sampling frequency of more than 100 Hz in order to track the typical human motion with a sufficient resolution. In this work, a method is proposed which allows to reduce the sampling frequency for sensor data by a factor of more than 10. The inaccuracies and fluctuations associated with the low sampling rate are compensated by applying a correction algorithm that takes the geometry of the underlying environment as well as the previous motion direction into account. A similar concept for sampling rate reduction and post-processing will also be applied to the data of an air pressure sensor. This sensor type can be used for movement detection in vertical direction. The adjustment of the sampling frequency is done adaptively based on the movement of the person subject to track. It will be shown that by using the proposed methods the accuracy of position tracking is comparable to that of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) operating at 200 Hz whereas the data rate and therewith the power consumption is reduced by a factor of more than 10. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup based on low-cost. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules.

A wake-up receiver system was developed from off-the-shelf components to detect these packets. It makes use of two differential signal paths separated by passive band-pass filters. After the rectification of each channel a differential amplifier compares the signals and the resulting wake-up signal is evaluated by an AS3933 wake-up receiver IC. Overall, the combination of these techniques contributes to a BLE compatible wake-up system which is more robust than traditional OOK wake-up systems. Thus, increasing wake-up range, while still maintaining a low energy budget. The proof-of-concept setup achieved a sensitivity of -47.8 dBm at a power consumption of 18.5 uW during passive listening. The system has a latency of 31.8 ms with a symbol rate of 1437 Baud.

Most of the existing assistive technologies (AT) rely on a single remaining ability, which is typically insufficient when performing complex computer tasks such as "drag and drop", typing long sentences, or selecting multiple items. In this work, a multimodal AT is presented to leverage both tongue gestures and head motion, simultaneously, to interact with target devices at latency and accuracy of 10 ms and 95.9%, respectively, measured among 15 able-bodied participants. A wearable headset transmits commands wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), utilizing a human interface device (HID) protocol for seamless interfacing with various applications running on PCs and smartphones without requiring a custom driver.

We present here a miniature, low power, 2 channel wireless neural recording system with sampling rates of 20ksps to allow researchers to understand the neurological functioning to develop therapies in freely moving small animals. The wireless implant uses Carbon Nano Tube Yarn (CNTY) electrodes to interface with the nervous system and record signals. High data transmission rates are achieved by using an Ultra-wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) transmitter and wireless switching control is provided by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The UWB transmitter is primarily designed to make it chronically implantable in freely moving rats to record neural activity but is also applicable to the telemetry of any signals such as surface EEG. Preliminary experiments and bench test results have confirmed its functioning for a distance range of more than 5m with high data transmission rate and low power consumption.

The microsystem comprises a previously developed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for activity-dependent intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), and the BLE link is dedicated to remote programming of the ICMS ASIC as well as to remote monitoring of several parameters such as the average stimulus rate, electrode site impedance, or power supply level. A prototype system is developed that incorporates the ICMS ASIC, SAMB11 BLE module, and peripheral electronics for supply management and ASIC monitoring, as well as a BLE user interface custom developed in C#. The end-to-end functionality of the BLE-enabled wireless link is experimentally demonstrated in representative benchtop tests in which several ASIC parameters are successfully programmed from the UBS over a distance of > 3.5m. The prototype system consumes similar to 618 mu W from a 3.6V, 1.6Ah, lithium-ion battery and is estimated to feature a lifetime of > 8 months for continuous operation, making it suitable for longitudinal studies with the ICMS ASIC in a non-human primate model.

In order to provide a low-cost solution, this generation of the device is constructed with only commercial off-the-shelf electronic components. A low-power electronic design addresses concerns about the thermal effects on the surrounding tissue. The heart rate monitoring accuracy is comparable to that of traditional electrocardiography measured with subdermal needle electrodes on rat models.

The minimization of latencies in a connection between Bluetooth-enabled terminals is the most important research issue with Bluetooth MANETs. In order to counter the issue, we have proposed a combination method between Classic Bluetooth (Classic) and connection-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). However, the latency of the combination method is still large and has limited applicability to Bluetooth MANETs in real world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method for Bluetooth MANETs to minimize the latency by utilizing both BLE-broadcast and Classic. In addition, since the procedure of connection establishment between terminals is performed in an autonomous distributed manner, the statuses of terminals can become deadlocked. To tackle this problem, we also propose and employ a new arbitration method by using uniquely assigned IDs for each terminal. We have implemented and evaluated our proposed method as applications for smartphones with Android OS. As a result, we can confirm that our proposed method has a reduced latency. In addition, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can achieve a 3-second latency in a configuration with deadlocks. Furthermore, we have confirmed that our proposed method can be frequently applied to larger-scaled networks.

Although the addition of a new device to a system always needs some actions such as assigning of an address and setting up specified parameters, none of the current solutions have automated this problem. This paper will describe a Home Automation System (HAuSy) framework with an automatic wireless node addressability process for use in large buildings, such as smart hotels. An optimized algorithm to automatically assign a large number of nodes in a smart building environment will be presented. This algorithm will be benchmarked in simulated tests. Finally, the benefits and possible extensions of this algorithm are discussed at the end of this article.

This uses an array of sensors distributed in the path. When the object with identification tag passes through the path, the sensors calculate the approximate distance from each of them with the help of a series of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values. The data is collected and is displayed on a user interface provided. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is used in the wireless sensor network. The RSSI values are mapped to corresponding distances by an initial training and this data is used for estimation of the distance. Path loss exponent and curve fitting methods are proposed for estimation of distance from the initial training data. Further, an error reduction method is also proposed for improving the accuracy of the estimation.

Five previously introduced attitude estimation algorithms were chosen and implemented in Windows IoT environment. A Texas Instrument CC2650STK wireless sensor was utilized to capture the raw magnetic/inertial data. The raw data was streamed to a DragonBoard 410c single board computer in real-time via Bluetooth low energy with the low sampling frequency. The sensor attitude was estimated using the attitude estimation algorithms continuously. A Shimmer 3 AHRS system was used as a golden standard, and the orientation of the Shimmer 3 was acquired using the Shimmer Consensys PRO 1.5 software. The experimental test showed poor agreement between the estimated and reference orientations and that the calculated orientation was dependent on an initial calibration. Based on the preliminary results and the current limitations in the wearable motion trackers, we may conclude that a precise estimation of a rigid body angle may not be achieved using wearable motion trackers in daily activities and other clinical applications.

The main challenge in fingerprinting-based localization is the severe fluctuations of received signal strength (RSS). Due to the fluctuations, localization results are often unstable. Therefore, we propose to define membership functions based on the distribution of RSS with a technique of fuzzy logic; specifically, a fuzzy rule is defined with offline data. Finally, fingerprinting method can find out the localization efficiently. The result of experiment show that the new method is effective to increase the stability of localization.

For patients, doctors, and administrators, the entire process can be exhausting and confusing. Usually, patients arrive at the front-desk and wait in a queue for assistance to begin preparing to be registered or admitted. Moreover, one of the most common patient complaints in clinics are the long and uncertain waiting times to see their doctor without any status updates. This can cause high levels of patient frustration and dissatisfaction. IoT is becoming an increasingly popular solution to healthcare problems. Imagine a patient walks into the clinic for her appointment, and receives a greeting message, an admission push notification and an estimated wait time on her mobile device. This will greatly reduce wait time uncertainty and provide freedom for patients to walk around which could lead to not just better experiences but less wasted money. This paper presents our proposed solution, which we called UrNext. UrNext is a location-aware mobile-based solution to solve the problem of patients queuing at clinics using a Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons.

There is a wide array of PDTs that a common person uses frequently including Automated Teller Machines (ATM), interactive kiosks, self-service kiosks and so on to accomplish numerous day-to-day tasks. Improving the usability of PDTs has been targeted from various aspects by Human Computer Interaction researchers. Research in this area has spanned from using multimodal approaches, revised guidelines for kiosk construction, navigation restructuring, to alternative methods of user authentication to provide an improved and enhanced user-experience. The main issue with the solutions provided to this day is that they all target improving the device. Providing a personalized solution remains unanswered. The widespread use of smartphones and tablets has given rise to the next generation of e-commerce commonly known as m-commerce. Although m-commerce have made huge strides in the areas of mobile payments, the area of making use of mobile technology with public access terminals is still limited. As technology edges towards cardless and contactless transactions, we propose to provide an accessible and scalable solution to the use of PDTs using proximity-aware technology. The main objective of the work presented in this paper is to identify and discuss the feasibility of using proximity-aware solutions to address the security, privacy and accessibility concerns when using PDTs.

The challenge of utilizing BLE in indoor localization is the characteristic of the observation area where multipath fading, shadowing, interference, and reflection of signal would appear. This paper proposed a new approach of evaluating the performance of wireless device communication system using BLE module in an indoor environment in term of estimating the position of the device using localization technique. Linear Regression method is used to refine the modeling distance parameter which measured previously. The simulation result shows that combining Linear Regression and Lognormal shadowing method for distance modeling will enhance the accuracy up to 99%.

In particular, discovering and bootstrapping a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy) between two devices that share no prior knowledge, commonly known as pairing, often requires users to go through cumbersome tasks of manually discovering the target device and entering a long passkey. When the devices do not have a proper user interface to enter a passkey, the security of pairing is often given up, leaving the communication vulnerable to a number of attacks. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a usable and secure out-of-band (OOB) communication method called SYNCVIBE, leveraging the inherent nature of close-proximity transmission of mechanical vibration. SYNCVIBE utilizes a vibration motor and an accelerometer, that are already ubiquitously available or easy to embed in mobile and wearable devices, to transmit and receive pairing information. By simply keeping two devices in direct contact, the user can bootstrap a secure, high-bandwidth wireless connection without manual pairing procedures. The proposed method maximizes accuracy and effective data throughput with a vibration clock recovery technique, which inserts a minimal amount of extra bit patterns to assure synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. In addition, SYNCVIBE can automatically adjust its detection thresholds in response to various vibration noises and transmission media. Our implementation of SYNCVIBE demonstrates high-accuracy transmission, proving itself as a suitable OOB communication channel for short data transmission for secure device pairing.

We use the received signal strength (RSS) of the wireless device and analyze the accuracy of estimated position by using the weighted centroid localization technique. For a comparison trough experiments, we developed an Android-based smart-phone application to collect both Wi-Fi and BLE RSS simultaneously at the same smart-phone. Experiments were conducted on the 6th floor of the general office building and both schemes were compared at 8 points in 16m x 7m space. According to the experimental results, it is shown that the performance between Wi-Fi and BLE can be different with respect to the density as well as the deployment of Wi-Fi APs and BLE beacons.

Finding lost properties in complex buildings using information and communication technologies (ICE) will be one of the LBS for smart city initiatives. The valued properties such as briefcase, mobile phone, wallet, handbag, and laptop may have a chance to be lost or are moved to somewhere in a building. If the property is lost, it could he staying in the same area when it was lost or be moved to anywhere both outside and inside building. GPS technique is used to search the lost property on the outdoor by the mobile or web application. However, indoor environment, it is very restrictive and doesn't have standard devices for looking for the property. Moreover, inside the building, some situations lead to being complicated such as closing corridor, electric shut down, or closing escalator. in this research, we develop an indoor space ontology model for finding the indoor lost property. The Bluetooth Low Energy devices (BLE) are applied to this research for analyzing the indoor locations. This ontology presents both static and dynamic location information for assisting BLE devices, users, and lost property. The privacy policy is design into the ontology to consider accessing to private lost property. This ontology can apply to 3-step searching process: computing user current location, determine property location and find lost property.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), due to the low energy consumption and generic service stack, has become one of the most popular wireless communication technologies for IoT. However, because of the short communication range and exclusive connection pattern, a BLE-equipped device can only be used by a single user near the device. To fully explore the benefits of BLE and make BLE-equipped devices truly accessible over the Internet as IoT devices, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based software framework that can enable multiple users to interact with various BLE IoT devices over the Internet. This framework includes an agent program, a suite of services hosting in cloud, and a set of RESTful APIs exposed to Internet users. Given the availability of this framework, the access to BLE devices can be extended from local to the Internet scale without any software or hardware changes to BLE devices, and more importantly, shared usage of remote BLE devices over the Internet is also made available.

First of all, multi-directional fingerprints are collected dynamically, and sparse fingerprint database is generated by combining Received Signal Strength (RSS) and coordinates. Subsequently, RSS of each new Reference Point (RP) is estimated by using optimized RBF approach. In particular, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize shape parameter, so as to improve interpolation accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve high localization accuracy as well as significantly reduce fingerprint database construction effort.

These applications often require the sensor positioning to link the measurements with its location. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies on BLE transmitter positioning methods. Power fingerprinting transmitter positioning approaches are commonly used in BLE network. However, these methods have their own limitations in terms of practical use and ease of implementation. The purpose is to develop a simple BLE transmitter positioning of high accuracy. In this paper, a BLE transmitter positioning method is proposed based on Angle of Arrival (AOA) estimation. Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is used for angle estimation due to the high angular resolution and sensitivity. Several experiments have been conducted in an indoor environment and the results compared with simulation results. Experimental results show that our proposed BLE transmitter positioning method achieves a promising positioning accuracy.

B	Carhacioglu, O; Zand, P; Nabi, M			IEEE	Carhacioglu, Onur; Zand, Pouria; Nabi, Majid			Cooperative Coexistence of BLE and Time Slotted Channel Hopping Networks	2018 IEEE 29TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS (PIMRC)			English	Proceedings Paper	29th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	SEP 09-12, 2018	Bologna, ITALY	IEEE		Cooperative Coexistence; Bluetooth Low Energy; IEEE 802.15.4e; TSCH; Wireless Sensor Networks		The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 are two of the most widely used technology standards for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In many applications, both technologies need to be used in the same environment to fulfill application requirements. However, since they share the same 2.4 GHz ISM band, such networks may suffer from cross-technology interference, which decreases the reliability of the network. To solve this problem, we propose a cooperative coexistence solution for BLE and TSCH networks in which joint time-slot and channel hopping synchronization are performed. The proposed solution uses a scheduling matrix to model the resource usage of the networks. Following this, the overlaps in this matrix are eliminated by rescheduling the transmissions of the networks. The proposed solution does not require any protocol change. The performance of the proposed cooperative coexistence mechanism is evaluated using experiments with real wireless devices. The results of those show that our proposed solution considerably decreases Packet Error Rate (PER); an improvement of up to 45% PER is observed.

This is expected to reduce the risk of infection that can be caused by penetrating the tissue in the human body. Hemoglobin measurement still generally use the invasive method, ie by taking and testing blood samples from patients. Therefore, it is proposed solving this problem using PPG signals recorded from the patient's finger using non-invasive method. The signal acquisition is done reflectively by irradiating the finger using 4 LEDs with different wavelengths and then the photodiode will capture the light that is not absorbed by the network. The hemoglobin level can be determined by calculating AC and DC components at each wavelength using linear regression method. The device will connect with smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 and will store the hemoglobin value that was measured. In addition, the application will show if the user is in normal condition or anemia as well as tips for people with anemia. The test results of this noninvasive device indicate 1.56 gr/dL RMS with maximum error 3.7 gr/dL and a standard deviation of 0.245 gr/dL. The results were obtained by comparing to invasive tools.

Low-power wireless nodes can achieve multi-year lifetimes with an AA battery using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Zig-Bee. However, replacing these batteries at scale is a non-trivial, labor-intensive task. Energy harvesting has emerged as a potential solution to avoid battery replacement but requires compromises such as application specific sensor node design, simplified communication protocol or reduced quality of service. We show the design of a battery-free sensor node using commercial off the shelf components, and present Pible: a Perpetual Indoor BLE sensor node that uses an ambient light energy harvesting system and can support numerous smart building applications. We show trade-offs between node-lifetime, quality of service and light availability and present a predictive algorithm that adapts to changing lighting conditions to maximize node lifetime and application quality of service.

There has been sufficient motivation on statistical analysis of Channel State Information of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data for more effective rangingbased models. However, there has been no ubiquitous solution which is both receiver-agnostic and does not require alteration in the advertisement protocol or packet structure of BLE. In this paper, we propose a truly unsupervised approach for channel-annotation of RSSI data received by a stationary receiver object. Given a sequence of RSSI observations and a discoverable receiver channel-switching policy, we determine the period and hence the time spent by the receiver in an individual channel. Then, we propose a sliding-window based algorithm which utilizes two well-established Likelihood-Ratio algorithms -KLIEP and uLSIF -for extracting Channel State Information of retrospective RSSI observation data. We believe this work lays the foundation of motivating future work in completely unsupervised methods for object-to-object ranging and localization.

This shift provides operators with a high level of reliability and efficiency when dealing with highly dynamic distribution grids. Technically, this implies that the support for a bidirectional flow of data is critical to realizing smart grid operation, culminating in the demand for equipping grid entities (such as sensors) with communication and processing capabilities. Unfortunately, the retrofitting of brown-field electric substations in distribution grids with these capabilities is not straightforward -this scenario requires a solution that provides "industry-grade" Internet of Things capabilities at "consumer-grade" prices (e.g., off-the-shelf communication standards and hardware). In this paper, we discuss the particular challenge of precisely time-synchronized wireless data collection in secondary substations that at the same time supports on-site configuration by authorized maintenance personnel through a mobile application: to achieve this, we propose a combined implementation of IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy.

In order to lower the energy consumption, BLE devices have to compromise with security and privacy problems. Existing research work shows that BLE devices can be easily spoofed and leveraged to gain access to a networking system. In this paper, we propose BF-IoT, the first IoT secure communication framework for BLE-based networks that guards against device spoofing via monitoring the worklife cycles of devices. We dig into the BLE protocol stack and extract the unique network-flow features from the link layer and ATT/GATT service layer so as to generate the fingerprints for device authentication. BF-IoT provides two-phase defense against malicious entities: continuously authenticating device identity before the connection setup and during session establishment. We build a customized system to validate the effectiveness of our mechanism. We extensively evaluate BF-IoT with a dozen of different off-the-shelf commodity IoT devices which shows that the devices can be accurately authenticated via only sniffing the transmission characteristics.

The slot antenna is formed on both a module substrate and a shield layer. The slot on the module substrate is short compared with the slot on the shield. Therefore, the slot occupies a small area on the module substrate, which makes the module substrate smaller. In addition to that, the slot antenna reduces the keep-out zone in which no wires can be laid out on the board. A prototype module was fabricated. The volume of the module is 5.25 x 9.0 x 1.0 mm(3). The module has received Japanese Radio Equipment Conformity Certification.

With growing demand for location-based service and rapid development of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), BLE PEPS with localization service becomes a promising choice for next generation of PEPS. This paper studies the critical problem of localizing the vehicle for user based on BLE received signal strength (RSS) provided by pre-installed BLE Access Points (APs) inside vehicle. Multiple APs are employed to reduce the error caused by RSS fluctuation on distance estimation. Fusion algorithms including Extended Kalman Filter, Monte Carlo Localization and Iterative Trilateration are compared based on experiments in vehicle. Experimental results show that distance estimation based on Extended Kalman Filter gets high accuracy in both long distance and short distance scenario.

The choice of transport, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, has an impact on the Internet of Things (IoT) application level performance, especially over a wireless medium. The motivation of this work is to look at the impact of the protocol stack on performance over two different wireless medium realizations, namely Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi. The use case studied is infrequent small reports sent from the sensor device to a central cloud storage over a last mile radio access link. We find that while CoAP/UDP based transport performs consistently better both in terms of latency and power consumption over both links, MQTT/TCP may also work when the use requirements allow for longer latency providing better reliability. All in all, the full connectivity stack needs to be considered when designing an IoT deployment.

In this paper, a comparative study between two soft computing techniques was done, namely, between: (a) a Multiple Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS) and (b) two different Artificial Neural Network structures - and this comparison was one investigated in relation with a practical embedded application. More precisely, the research used a new wearable system, named Intell.TieSens, in order to model the complex nonlinear relationship that exist between the capacitive sensors embedded in a tie collar and the 3D head position of the wearer of that tie. The Intell.TieSens system was designed to be a noncontact system, low power, portable, lightweight, having a Bluetooth Low Energy wireless data communication capability in order to be able both to be paired with a personal computer or with a smartphone and to identify in real time the human 3D head position. The results showed the superior performances obtained with MANFIS system - two times better than the performances obtained with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural network. Out of the tested models, the MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) neural network obtained the lowest performances.

Prosthetic hands are often used for the reconstruction of the function of the fingers of upper limb amputees. There are many patients who wish to wear myoelectric prosthetic hands. However, it is not popular now in Japan. Hoshikawa et al. developed simplified myoelectric prosthetic hand as an easy-to-use one. However, it has problems with learning speed and scalability. In this research, Shadow System BLE was developed to solve the problem. This system can perform learning calculation and identification on a smartphone connected by Bluetooth Low Energy. We confirmed that it can perform learning calculation at high speed using abundant computing resources and can demonstrate the same identification rate as conventional system. Normally, since the smartphone is connected to the Internet, it is possible to use the server for identification or to use the Web API in the future.

Low cost and power efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology's ability to run maintenance-free for many years on a single coin cell battery provides an attractive methodology to realize accurate and low cost indoor spatial tracking. However an easy to deploy and accurate methodology still remains a problem of ongoing research interest. We propose a field deployable tracking system based on BLE beacon signals together with a particle filter based approach for online and real-time tracking of persons with a body-worn Bluetooth receiver to support fine grain human behavior observations. First, we develop the concept of generic sensor models for generalized indoor environments and build pluggable sensor models for re-use in unseen environments during deployment. Second, we exploit pose information and void constraints in our problem formulation to derive additional information about the person tracked. Third, we build the infrastructure to easily setup and operate our tracking system to support end-users to remotely track ambulating persons in real-time over a web-based interface. Fourth, we assess five different tracking methodologies together with two approaches for formulating pose information and show that our method of probabilistic multilateration including the modeling of pose leads to the best performance; a mean path estimation error of 23.5 cm in a new indoor environment.

BLE is a common technology for this kind of geopositioning systems, but most of the existing proposals are based on the RSS (Received Signal Strength) value obtained by mobile smart devices from static emitters such as iBeacons or other similar tags. This is not our case, since we adopt a passive approach where monitors obtain advertising frames emitted by mobile BLE beacons with no computing capabilities. In our particular scenario, based on a commercial application of our system, we perform fast but exhaustive training procedures to produce an initial dataset that is then analyzed paying attention to important design parameters. A thorough analysis of the data by means of different data visualization techniques reveals valuable information about the behavior of the emitters, signal characterization, radio coverage and, mainly, possible features that can be employed lately by machine learning methods in order to provide accurate location estimations. This is useful to define a quick and continuous training life-cycle which enables the detection of inconsistent data or failures. Our analysis also suggests that a representation of the observations using alternative features provides similar or even better results than the RSS values in terms of efficiency and support for heterogeneous devices.

Since almost all the railway facilities are arranged along the railway lines, we have developed a condition monitoring system using the opportunistic communication which makes a moving receiver on a train collect automatically the monitoring data of the wireless sensors installed on the railway facilities. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), which is one kind of active RFID was used for communication. We selected connectionless broadcast topology of BLE and succeeded in collecting temperature, heat flow and acceleration data of BLE sensors from the Shinkansen train running at the speed of about 255 km/h.

Piezologist is an unobtrusive chest worn device. It comprises a patch-type sensor and a mobile application. The sensor utilizes piezoelectric material as the cardiorespiratory signal sensing component and MetaWearC board as the signal acquisition unit. The board also comes with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support which is utilized for the raw signal transmission. The novelty aspect of the system rests on the fact that not only using a single cheap piezoelectric sheet common cardiorespiratory parameters (such as heart rate, respiration rate, and cycles) were obtained similar to previous studies but ECG waveform and blood pressure data were also extracted successfully using the same sensor. In addition, sensor packaging design and prototyping and their effect on the acquired signal strength on one hand and the package size (volume and weight) on the other hand were studied and reported. For performance validation purpose, the developed cardiorespiratory monitoring sensor system results were validated against two commercial sensor devices namely 3-lead ECG sensor from eHealth sensor kit and Zephyr belt-type BioHarness sensor, and the results were reported herein. The validation process outcomes confirmed that the cardiorespiratory signals extracted using Piezologist conform with a heartbeat, respiratory cycle and ECG waveform obtained using the commercial sensors. Furthermore, a usability study was conducted to compare the user experience offered by Piezologist against commercially available sensors for measuring cardiorespiratory parameters. The study highlighted the potential that Piezologist will take over the commercial available belt-type, watch-type and 3-lead ECG sensors.

The introduced system is cost-efficient, easy to install, and can be used for a long time without an external power source. An energy-aware algorithm is proposed, which uses a scheduling mechanism to manage wireless nodes that can act as BLE beacons (in low energy mode) or receivers.

Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based tracking app to gather the location of employees. Secondly, the generated sensor data from gateway is then stored into NoSQL MongoDB. The proposed system was tested for monitoring the movement of employees in the workplace. The results showed that commercial versions of the BLE-based device and the proposed system are sufficiently efficient for RTLS.

These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

Since Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is available in almost every IoT device in the market nowadays, a key to localizing and tracking IoT devices is to develop an accurate ranging technique for BLE-enabled IoT devices. This is, however, a challenging feat as billions of these devices are already in use, and for pragmatic reasons, we cannot propose to modify the IoT device (a BLE peripheral) itself. Furthermore, unlike WiFi ranging - where the channel state information (CSI) is readily available and the bandwidth can be increased by stitching 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands together to achieve a high-precision ranging, an unmodified BLE peripheral provides us with only the RSSI information over a very limited bandwidth. Accurately ranging a BLE device is therefore far more challenging than other wireless standards. In this paper, we exploit characteristics of BLE protocol (e.g. frequency hopping and empty control packet transmissions) and propose a technique to directly estimate the range of a BLE peripheral from a BLE access point by multipath profiling. We discuss the theoretical foundation and conduct experiments to show that the technique achieves a 2.44m absolute range estimation error on average.

The MG controller was composed of three pairs of a pressure sensor and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless data logger for the upper and lower jaws. The pressure sensors and the BLE data loggers were sandwiched by two dental MG materials so that they were not exposed in the oral environment. Pressure applied to the sensor was measured as a resistance change, and an algorithm that exploited the sensor output to regulate the control of an external device, such as a smart device, was developed. The pressure sensor encapsulated in the MG material showed a dynamic range of 1.7-29 N. In an experiment using a jaw phantom, the response time to applied occlusal pressure was 0.18 s. Finally, the use of the measured pressure to manipulate a pointer in a smart device application was demonstrated. The results indicate that the developed MG controller enables the manipulation of devices in one's vicinity via occlusion.

The SDK typically provides to developers an easy way to extract this data and use it to implement their algorithms. However, RSSI based localization techniques have known limits. An alternative information to be used in ranging for localization purposes is Time-of-Flight (ToF). Still, this data is not provided by the BLE API, therefore we propose a practical approach for ToF extraction on top of BLE to be used as alternative to or in combination with RSSI. Furthermore, with the paper, we release the sources of the library used to perform the ToF measurement on BLE, that can be used per se or as input for a localization algorithm. We tested the measurements indoor and outdoor at different distances, both considering Line-of-Sight free or occluded by user body. We conclude evaluating ranging performance, test repeatability and comparing the obtained results with the popular RSSI based approach.

They can also be very useful in medical applications, as an individual's indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status. Research for indoor localization systems is ongoing and there are numerous solutions with different hardware or algorithmic approaches, for different use cases. Ease of setup and cost are significant factors when using indoor localization systems for medical applications. This paper proposes an indoor localization system with room-level accuracy, focusing on an easy installation procedure that can be easily followed from non-technical staff, as well as on low cost, so that it can be widely adopted. The proposed system has been mainly designed for behavioural monitoring of adults in an indoor environment. The system operates by tracking a carried device based on the processing of RSS (Received Signal Strength) measurements from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons placed in the area. The proposed system has been evaluated in realistic settings and and achieves an accuracy of 95.31% in room estimation.

The issue has been a hidden underneath bit energy and power consumptions of the devices. First, recent advances have changed energy consumption of the devices and secondly, in terms of power efficiency, the coding gain of the systems have been suppressed by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) definition where the bit energy to noise ratio (Eb/No) value of the reception is more meaningful providing direct comparative value for the systems. In the end, the paper has concluded that the diversity gains of the systems are more effective, whatever the technique can provide a diversity gain over statistical average.

However, the key challenge in designing WPT-supplied smart sensors is to ensure that the harvested power is higher than the consumed power in presence of strong WPT path loss. This paper presents the design and optimization of a smart sensor supplied by 2.45-GHz RF power and performing infrared-based motion detection and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The full system (RF energy harvester, power management, sensor transducer and interface, control, data processing and wireless transmission) is implemented using low-power off-the-shelf components. In the sensing sub-system, low average power is achieved using efficient duty-cycling of the analog front-end. In the harvesting sub-system, architecture choice and design of the matching network and rectifier circuit allow to optimize the total power harvesting efficiency (PHE). The implemented smart sensor can operate reliably with an incident RF power as low as -10.9 dBm. The sensing sub-system exhibits an average power of 4.3 mu W and a maximum number of transmitted event packets of 60 packets per hour.

J	Kim, M; Lee, J; Paek, J				Kim, Moonbeom; Lee, Jongho; Paek, Jeongyeup			Neutralizing BLE Beacon-Based Electronic Attendance System Using Signal Imitation Attack	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Proximity-based application; electronic attendance systems; Bluetooth low energy; BLE beacon; vulnerability analysis		Many emerging location- or proximity-based applications use Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons thanks to the increasing popularity of the technology in mobile systems. An outstanding example is the BLE beacon-based electronic attendance system (BEAS) used in many universities today to increase the efficiency of lectures. Despite its popularity and usefulness, however, BEAS has not been thoroughly analyzed for its potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we neutralize a university's BEAS by maliciously cheating attendance (i.e., faking attendance while the subject is not physically present at the location) in various scenarios using signal imitation attack, and investigate its possible vulnerabilities. The BEAS exploited in this paper is a commercial system actually used in a well-known university. After the exploitation experiment, we analyze the system's weaknesses and present possible counter-measures. Furthermore, additional attack methods are shown to re-counteract those possible counter-measures and to discuss the fundamental challenges, deficiencies, and suggestions in electronic attendance systems using BLE beacons.

One aspect of these connected products that still needs attention is the means by which they are powered. An attractive and feasible option is the use of energy harvesting from acoustic fields. Previous work developing a piezoelectric energy harvesting device has generated 2.6 mW of power from a hydraulic test rig. This paper presents an implementation of an energy harvesting device connected to a communications system that allows it to store energy and communicate sensor readings via Bluetooth Low Energy.

Currently, the cares of elders and children existed some problems of management for several years. Therefore, the IoT is expanded to position and monitor walks of elders and children in a local area. However, the proposed positioning or monitoring systems have high costs and power consumption. In addition, most proposed systems are demanded to match up a smartphone, but the smartphones bring other problems for elders and children. Therefore, a wearable device positioning system, in this study, is proposed. This study main aims at addressing the challenges for those proposed systems to develop a low cost and power consumption system by wearable devices and raspberry pi boards through Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmission. Furthermore, the text marquee and Google Cloud Message push-notification are added to the wearable device positioning system to prevent dangers occurred in the bathrooms and outdoor areas.

STERLING: A framework for serious games to encourage recycling	REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments III	SEP 10-12, 2018	Berlin, GERMANY	SPIE		Waste disposal; recycling; low-cost sensors; low-energy sensors; gamification; IoT		Waste disposal and recycling is becoming one of the main problems in Western countries. Improving both recycling culture among citizenship and waste collection and treatment logistics is critical to augment the percentage of waste being recycled. In this paper we present STERLING, an initiative that aims to help in both fields. STERLING is a framework composed by a low-cost, low-energy sensor installed in recycling containers to measure fill level and other physical parameters. The sensor is activated magnetically each time the container lid is opened by a user. Instead of directly sending this information to a cloud-based server, our sensor broadcasts a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet to the surrounding area. An App running in the mobile phone of the user performs two actions: To capture this information, re-sending it to the cloud-based server, and to assign credit to this particular user for having used the recycling container. In this way, users are rewarded for using the container, and the infrastructure bene fits from cost-free communications from the container to the server. In this paper we will describe our idea in detail, showing how it can be used to develop a rewarding schema that encourages recycling.

Wireless technologies, despite their offered convenience, flexibility, low cost, and mobility pose unique challenges such as fading, interference, energy, and security, which must be carefully addressed when using resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, the efforts of the research community have led to the standardization of several wireless technologies for various types of application domains depending on factors such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we first overview these standard wireless technologies, and we specifically study the MAC and physical layer technologies proposed to address the requirements and challenges of wireless communications. Furthermore, we explain the use of these standards in various application domains, such as smart homes, smart healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities, and discuss their suitability in satisfying the requirements of these applications. In addition to proposing guidelines to weigh the pros and cons of each standard for an application at hand, we also examine what new strategies can be exploited to overcome existing challenges and support emerging IoT applications.

J	Wang, XL; Xu, K; Mao, B				Wang, Xiaoliang; Xu, Ke; Mao, Bo			GreenLink: An Energy Efficient Scatternet Formation for BLE Devices	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							BLUETOOTH; ALGORITHM	Formation technology of Bluetooth scatternet has been researched for over a decade and promoted by rapid development of wearable computing. Limited by technical features, the traditional scatternet formation technology has not been widely used in real commercial chipsets. As new features are introduced into the Bluetooth core field, the ability to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to construct a network becomes the reality and puts forward new challenges. The scatternet formation technology facing to BLE and wearable devices requires significant improvement in energy efficiency. According to our experiments, 92% of the system energy consumption can be attributed to central nodes. In this paper, we presented a Bluetooth scatternet formation technology focused on energy efficiency, GreenLink, which minimizes the amount of central nodes by enhancing system aggregation degree to ensure excellent energy-saving performance. Meanwhile, we implemented a prototype of GreenLink on Nordic nRF51822 chipsets, conducted experiments, and verified in practice. According to the experiments, GreenLink used only 30% central nodes and reduced 50% system energy consumption compared with traditional technology.

One of the added features is an automatic addressing when a new node is added to the system. The process of addressing wired nodes is straightforward. However, problems arise when large amounts of wireless Bluetooth Low Energy nodes must be dealt with. There are limitations that come from the hardware side, due to having three layers of architecture. It can be described as an evaluated bipartite graph. A proposal for how to deal with the address assignment problem is presented and the best fit is selected for future implementation. It is shown that complete task automation is not possible, and user interventions will be necessary. Finally, the technology requirements for the software plugin features so as to allow comfortably solving the presented issues are described.

An event-driven technique is applied to the biosignal, minimising power consumption, complexity, and transmitted data. The acquisition board transmits four channels sEMG event data, through a Bluetooth Low Energy wireless module, to a workstation where they are processed in order to control the stimulation pattern of a commercially available functional stimulator.

It exploits the number of thresholdcrossing events, generated by a full-custom acquisition board, from the surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals of three forearm muscles to detect four different movements of the wrist: flexion, extension, abduction and grasp. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has been trained with the signals acquired from ten subjects, who repeated ten times each gesture. To avoid correlation between training and testing dataset, the Leave One Subject Out (LOSO) cross-validation technique has been chosen. The average ATC classifier's accuracy is 92.87 %, only 5.34% below the results obtained feeding the same model with the sEMG features extracted from the raw sampled signals. The total latency of the algorithm, from the acquisition to the prediction, is 160 ms. Power consumption was considered too: with less than the power budget for one sampled sEMG channel, it is possible to acquire and transmit (through a Bluetooth low energy module) the eventdriven data of four sEMG channels, with an effective data rate of only 28 B/s. Obtained performance makes this technique suited for wearable systems or Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.

It is built around a hybrid 2nd-order Delta Sigma closed-loop phase/frequency detector (Delta Sigma PFD) that facilitates analog quality detection of a radio frequency (RF) carrier and tracking of its frequency modulation. Addressing the IoT chipsets low-power consumption requirements, a passive Delta Sigma PFD is presented that features programmable digitization resolution assisted by mixed-signal finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and digital noise cancellation.

In [12], it has been shown that by detecting and analyzing the current pattern, a class of time synchronization schemes can be devised. In this paper, we study the accuracy of one of the methods of this class in several conditions which can affect the accuracy of the current consumption pattern such as device dependency, transmit power, and temperature. Extensive analysis with several BLE devices and various parameter combinations has been done by experimental measurements.

Continuous monitoring of vital parameters allows detecting diseases in an early state. In this paper, we propose a wrist-wearable low-power device able to monitor body physiological signals as temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and monitor daily activities and on this basis to detect falls. The device is also able to transmit and receive data with an Android App using a Bluetooth Low-Energy interface. For counting the beats, we propose a novel low processing consumption peak detection algorithm. For detecting the oxygen saturation some approaches have been followed (in time and frequency domains) to obtain the attributes for the further functional analyses of the monitoring process. The results show the monitoring and tracking functionalities of this wearable. Tests performed shows the good performing of all sensors, being able to measure body temperature, detect and measure heart rate and oxygen saturation with less than a 2% of deviation and detect mostly of the most usual fall types; all this integrated in a low-power low-size solution. As the conclusion, the viability of this implementation has been more than proved given the fact that some providers are interested in deploying such wearable in their elderly home residences.

The system should allow the monitoring of combustion engines usage, detect faults remotely, and is focused on IC engines for maritime applications. It consists of two parts, as explained in the following. The first part involves the development of the device, which should be capable of performing a continuous monitoring of an engine's activity and register its working periods. This decision is made based on the vibration analysis. As a requirement, the developed device must be low-cost, portable and have a low energy consumption to provide at least two years of autonomy. The second part involves fault's detection and, like the first part, it requires information from the engine's vibrations. A low power accelerometer will be used to monitor the engine's activity, and a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride film is used to record the engine's vibration, for fault detection. The data is then sent via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone, which forwards it to the Internet, for further analysis. Bluetooth Low Energy is used to support the required autonomy. The developed technique for fault detection includes data acquisition, analog and digital pre-processing and digital processing. The most important part of the digital processing, in this case, is a Time-Frequency Analysis. Several Time-Frequency Analysis algorithms were tested with real data to select the best solution to detect faults in such engines.

Three protocols in particular, Zigbee, Z-wave, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are used for network communication on a significant number of IoT devices. However, devices utilizing each of these three protocols have been compromised due to either implementation failures by the manufacturer or security shortcomings in the protocol itself. This paper identifies the security features and shortcomings of each protocol citing employed attacks for reference. Additionally, it will serve to help manufacturers make two decisions: First, should they invest in creating their own protocol, and second, if they decide against this, which protocol should they use and how should they implement it to ensure their product is as secure as it can be. These answers are made with respect to the specific factors manufacturers in the IoT space face such as the reversed CIA model with availability usually being the most important of the three and the ease of use versus security tradeoff that manufacturers have to consider. This paper finishes with a section aimed at future research for IoT communication protocols.

In particular, localization through the use of IoT is highly effective for watching over seniors, searching a missing child or detecting risky incidents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system of localization that can be used as an accurate monitoring device for regular use and as a localization device with low power consumption and a long span operation for emergency use. The low power consumption is realized by switching to the system operated on Bluetooth Low Energy. As a result of experiments with actual machines, our proposed system could localize the area of a terminal located within 5 m distance with 100% accuracy. Moreover, its correct position can be identified with 84.2% accuracy by using the finger print method.

The low power consumption of Bluetooth low energy (LE) devices compared to the conventional Bluetooth devices has enhanced its importance in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Therefore, Bluetooth low energy device based solution needs expansion in the IoT network infrastructure. The transceivers in the literature and modulation schemes are compared and summarized. Energy consumption of modulation schemes in Bluetooth communication are analyzed and compared using the model presented in this work. In this approach considering both circuit and signal power consumption, optimum modulation order for minimum energy consumption has been found using numerical calculation and relation between signal to noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. Battery life for IoT sensors using Bluetooth LE technology as a wireless link has been analyzed considering multiple transaction times for transmitters having different power consumption. MFSK and more bandwidth-efficient GFSK are identified as low energy solution for all smart devices.

Although some variants exist, IoT systems are basically composed of many devices and servers and therefore require the development of both device-and server-side systems. This makes the development of IoT system difficult. In this paper, an IoT architecture is proposed that avoids this requirement, thereby simplifying the IoT system development. As an example of our proposed architecture, we present a Global Positioning System (GPS) improvement system from the device side only. Each device communicates with other devices to acquire more accurate GPS data. The accuracy of our GPS improvement system was verified with prototype application.

The release of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Bluetooth Smart, allows for a major improvement in data transfer using IPv6 over BLE, as proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 7668. IPv6 through BLE is widely used for IoT devices, however, connection to a raspberry pi 3 device, the most used mobile operating system, is widely underdeveloped. In this paper, we attempt to create a link-layer connection, guided by 6LoWPANs (stands for IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) from RFC 4919, between two raspberry pi 3s to transfer IPv6 packets.

S	Ha, M; Lindh, T			IEEE	Ha, Minkeun; Lindh, Thomas			Enabling Dynamic and Lightweight Management of Distributed Bluetooth Low Energy Devices	2018 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS (ICNC)	International Conference on Computer Networking and Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	MAR 05-08, 2018	Maui, HI				INTERNET; THINGS	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLE-LWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator's LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.

These two facts are important for IoT applications making BLE a good candidate to be chosen over other communication technologies (WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth Classic). One key point of the automatic fare collection system is the passenger detection. As passenger nowadays are likely to carry smartphones with embedded BLE function. Therefore, first in this paper will be explained how Bluetooth Low Energy can be used in public transportation systems such as in a Low Floor Wireless Tram to check if someone took in fact a public transportation vehicle (such as: bus, train, metro or tram) or if he or she is just nearby (waiting for the next vehicle for example). Next, it will be explained how to improve Bluetooth Low Energy passenger's location detection when using RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indication) for this task.

Especially, it can be regarded as an essential element for the ship's safety. However, unlike terrestrial communication, there is a disadvantage in that fixed terrain cannot be used. Therefore, communications of maritime were common to use a satellite or combinations of VHF and satellite. However, in case of fishing vessels using marine resources, although they cannot prepare for marine accidents, they don't use those communications on the coast because of exposing their fishing positions such as their know-how. In this paper, we propose a system that can additionally contribute to preventing marine accidents as making a local network by using Bluetooth and noting the dangerous situation at the coast.

BLE has become a recent topic of research in both the Internet and the wireless industry. This paper introduces BLEmesh, a wireless mesh network protocol which utilizes the broadcasting capability of wireless transmissions. The available data payload using BLE's Generic Access Profile (GAP) is used for data transfer. The data from different number of nodes and packets are send in batches. The nRF51822 device is used to implement the mesh network with the use of the soft device application provided by the developers to configure the node to switch between a peripheral and central node for data transfer. Three different sensors, namely heart beat sensor, temperature sensor, and touch sensor, are interfaced with the nRF51822 to show the mesh network working, and also the values are tabulated. The results indicate that the latency and power consumption of the proposed BLEmesh network is less than previous implementations.

Such devices are not reachable outside of their Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). However, users' needs are sometimes incompatible with this limited reachability. Our goal is to break this barrier and provide location-independent connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a new abstraction layer, called RCM (Remote Connection Manager) enabling transparent communication between an application and a remote short-range device. We implemented our solution for Bluetooth Low Energy technology and demonstrated its feasibility through experiments performed on real devices.

In order to support the mesh topology in BLE networks, several proposals have been designed. Among them, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) recently released a specification for Bluetooth mesh networks based upon BLE technology. This paper focuses on this standard solution and analyses its security protocol with hardware security in mind. As it is expected that internet of things (IoT) devices will be deployed everywhere, the risk of physical attacks must be assessed. First, we provide a comprehensive survey of the security features involved in Bluetooth mesh. Then, we introduce some physical attacks identified as serious threats for the IoT and discuss their relevance in the case of Bluetooth mesh networks. Finally, we briefly discuss possible countermeasures to reach a secure implementation.

We employ the positioning data of users; thus, we avoid recording the action or any conversation pertaining to the users. We use the beacon signal to find a user's location and choose a subgroup, which is a temporary group obtained using the location of the users. The proposed method analyzes the familiarity using two different methods. The proximity-based method is used to calculate the familiarity based on the time for which the user has stayed in the subgroup. The direction-based method is used to calculate the familiarity based on the direction of each user in the subgroup. This study addressed situations arising in an event or a group activity in indoors to analyze the degree of familiarity by determining the location of a user.

For this purpose, both the hardware and the software aspects are considered. Thus, the BLE software stack from Texas Instruments and the CC2541 platform were chosen. Considering the CC2541 Keyfob device which contains an accelerometer, new facilities are firstly introduced by modifying the existing embedded software. Then, a new hardware component is connected, and the necessary software components are included in order to use this new element. The two main applications that are employed to monitor the activity of the BLE devices are analyzed and a new one based on MATLAB is introduced to improve the facilities of the existing applications. Thus, using the ideas presented in this paper, new BLE devices can be developed.

In addition, a linkage between device properties / values to logical identifiers used in process control code has to be adapted using a correct mapping of memory areas within the process memory acquired from the device. In order to exchange an automation device by a similar one, all steps above have to be adapted and checked until it can be used productively. To meet flexibility requirements of future automation scenarios, the integration and commissioning process of automation devices has to be made more flexible, less error-prone and less dependent of boundary conditions. This paper presents a concept for self-description of automation devices based on wireless communication using 802.15.1 (Bluetooth Low Energy) to facilitate commissioning processes of devices and assist engineers in process definition and device selection during development phase. A demonstrator is realized to validate this concept.

J	Lin, CY; Liao, KH; Chang, CH				Lin, Chi-Yi; Liao, Kai-Hung; Chang, Chia-Hsuan			An Experimental System for MQTT/CoAP-based IoT Applications in IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; 6LoWPAN; MQTT; CoAP		With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), it is an inevitable trend that all things will get connected to the Internet to form various intelligent services such as Industry 4.0, smart home, smart medical care, etc. To make such intelligent IoT services practicable, it is vital to have a low-power link-layer technology that can accommodate a diversity of upperlayer networking protocols. Currently, there are many popular low-power wireless networking technologies for IoT such as ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Because of the ubiquity of BLE-enabled smartphones nowadays, BLE has gained much attention in the IoT industry recently. In this research, we aim at implementing an IPv6 over BLE experimental system using Raspberry Pi 3 and nRF51-DK development boards, and then run the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over the protocol stack of IPv6/BLE. Specifically, in our experimental system every BLE node is IPv6-addressable and accessible through the MQTT/CoAP protocols from anywhere over the Internet. Moreover, to ease user accesses from ordinary web browsers, we build two gateways as the web servers for end users, which receive real-time sensor data via CoAP or MQTT-SN protocols and then push the data to end users' browsers. The gateways are also designed to routinely request sensor data and then forward the data to cloud database platforms, which serve as the data sources for historical sensor data. Preliminary results showed that our system is capable of achieving the designed goals and is user-friendly. Compared with the non-IP based BLE sensor networks, our implementation can be integrated into a variety of existing and widely used IP-based applications easily.

Interaction with a certain proximity and thing is bringing smarter services into our daily lives through cyber-physical world collaboration. Push notification of meaningful content associated with the proximity or thing is one of key technologies of the cyber-physical services. For example, empty parking spot recommendation in a parking lot or promotion coupon notification of a shop at a shopping cent er should be delivered accordingly. This paper explores reliable push notification of content for novel interactive mobile applications over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure. Since mobile users move around with different speeds, this paper deals with such difference to relay right content in a reliable manner, called Reliable Push Notification (RPN). RPN dynamically clusters contents and links them to a beacon to achieve reliability, and then adaptively pre-allocate contents for transmission.

Given a floor plan, inertial and signature-based systems can converge on accurate locations by slowly pruning away inconsistent states as a user walks through the space. In contrast, range-based systems are capable of instantly acquiring locations, but they rely on densely deployed beacons and suffer from inaccurate range measurements given non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. In order to get the best of both worlds, we present an approach that systematically exploits the geometry information derived from building floor plans to directly improve location acquisition in range-based systems. Our solving approach can disambiguate multiple feasible locations taking into account a mix of LOS and NLOS hypotheses to accurately localize with significantly fewer beacons. We demonstrate our geometry-aware solving approach using a new ultrasonic beacon platform that is able to perform direct time-of-flight ranges on commodity smartphones. The platform uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for time synchronization and ultrasound for measuring propagation distance. We evaluate our system's accuracy with multiple deployments in a university campus and show that our approach shifts the 80% accuracy point from 4-8m to 1m as compared to solvers that do not use the floor plan information. We are able to detect and remove NLOS signals with 91.5% accuracy.

The growth of technology can be incorporated with the rising events triggering a need for a better lifestyle. Recent technological advancement which has influenced a change in lifestyle, is the field of IoT (Internet of Things). The applications of IoT are vast and innumerable. One such application can be implied for the Automobile industry to improve the quality and safety of the vehicles. With the increase in number of accidents and the deteriorating performance of the cars, there is a need for a pragmatic real time monitoring system and a self-learning algorithm for smart predictions. We use the Raspberry Pi as our GPU running Machine Learning algorithm [K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) and [Valve Bayesian algorithm] predicting the vehicle condition and life prediction of Engine, Coolant, etc. We are planning to implement such a system which will be user friendly and user interactive. We propose two methods for data handling, 1] Develop Bluetooth low energy technology as the communication module for data transmission to the cloud database. 2] Alternatively, 4G Dongle can be used for transmitting data directly to the cloud and the mobile application from the Raspberry pi. The cutting edge feature of BLE is its low power consumption and can also be integrated to many sensors at any point in time (scalable technology). Our prototype is using the BLE Communication for OBD-II (On board Diagnostics) - Raspberry pi communication and Wi-Fi for cloud interfacing. We have integrated OBD-II in a FORD Manufactured car to extract the following data: Speed, air pressure, temperature, CO2 emission, GPS Coordinates, Fuel Level indicator sensor. The Raspberry Pi will run the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm and output the results and live prediction of vehicle condition to the mobile application.

Low-power Bluetooth technology has the characteristics of low-cost, easy deployment and low power consumption, supporting all mainstream smartphone operating systems, and attracting extensive attention from academic and industry field. In this paper, aiming at the situation that current Bluetooth low energy positioning accuracy has large fluctuation under the circumstance of multipath propagation, external disturbance and other factors, and has poor user experience, a Bluetooth localization algorithm based on map path calibration and time series filtering is proposed (MCTF). This algorithm comprehensively utilizes a post-processing method based on the average sliding window, time-series based spatial restraint post-processing method and path information based location calibration method, effectively eliminating the large fluctuation of positioning results caused by multipath propagation and other external wireless signal interference in complex indoor environment. By using map information, based on the fact that position cannot be transient, utilizing feedback filtering, positioning results can get path correction and direction correction respectively, solving the problem that the positioning coordinates jump between adjacent narrow aisles and jump back and forth on the same path during the positioning process. Extensive experiments performed in shopping mall, building office, exhibition center and other typical indoor environments demonstrate that the average positioning error of the proposed algorithm is within 1.5 m, which has good robustness and ensures the smoothness, accuracy and stability of the positioning result.

The Internet of Things had a very big impact on the technology as we know today. One important aspect, not yet standardized, is the way in which objects connect to the network in order to function together. In particular, in medical domain, the Internet of Things faces a high number of technical limitations, most of them related to the electromagnetic emissions. Until the 5G network will create the infrastructure for sensors direct to the internet, the connection through Bluetooth Low Energy remains the most suitable solution for Internet of Things connectivity.

J	Boric, M; Redondo, RPD; Vilas, AF				Boric, Miran; Diaz Redondo, Rebeca P.; Fernandez Vilas, Ana			Space Occupancy through BLE Dynamic Broadcasting	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY	Internet of Things (IoT) merges different technologies to provide the needed infrastructure for an adequate inter-device connection and data exchange, with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) being one of the latest acquisitions. The use of BLE beacons offers a straightforward approach to broadcast information to any device being in the coverage zone and able to process such signal. Instead of this static solution, in this paper, we face an alternative approach that, combining both Wi-Fi and BLE beacon technologies, is able to dynamically adapt the information being broadcast depending on the particular devices in the coverage area. Taking advantage of the beacon device communications, we propose to monitor the space occupancy throughout the study area (typically inside a building) by following the beacon device data exchange. This information would be later used to improve space analysis. As a proof of concept, we have conducted an experiment inside a faculty to check the potentiality of the proposal, obtaining promising results.

The BLE neighbor discovery process (NDP) based on active scanning may be the core of multiple IoT applications in which a large and varying number of users/devices/tags must be detected in a short period of time. Minimizing the discovery latency and maximizing the number of devices that can be discovered in a limited time are challenging issues due to collisions between frames sent by advertisers and scanners. The mechanism for resolution of collisions between scanners has a great impact on the achieved performance, but backoff in NDP has been poorly studied so far. This paper includes a detailed analysis of backoff in NDP, identifies and studies the factors involved in the process, reveals the limitations and problems presented by the algorithm suggested by the specifications and proposes simple and practical adaptations on scanner functionality. They are easily compatible with the current definitions of the standard, which together with a new proposal for the backoff scheme, may significantly improve the discovery latencies and, thus, the probability of discovering a large number of devices in high density scenarios.

However, most low-power IoT devices cannot transmit the collected the data directly to such servers due the limited transmission power and range. Thus, third-party devices such as smart mobile phones are used as a relay to establish the communication link between IoT devices and the cloud server. This paper demonstrates a mobile-based relay assistance solution for secure end-to-end connectivity between low-power IoT sensors and cloud servers by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The prototype implementation verifies the technical readiness of the proposed solution.

The TI Sensor Tag is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device which consumes very low power during its operation and it uses single coin battery for months of life. It uses the Bluez Library for reading the data from different sensors of Sensor Tag. Now-a-days the traffic on the road has been increasing drastically due to increase in number of vehicle users. On the other hand the simple time based traffic control system is not sufficient for controlling the uneven traffic on the roads during peak hours, which calls for a new Traffic control system. The gesture technology has become very popular for HMI (Human Machine Interface), which provides a virtual environment for controlling devices by giving Gestures. Here we used the Ti Sensor Tag for Hand Gesture Recognition.	[Yasmeen, Gandluri; Arun, S.; Swaminathan, J. N.; Jilani, S. A.

Batteries, which are today the most common source of energy supply for these devices, have many limitations. The limited capacity and the negative environmental effect of their production and recycling are among the most crucial ones. Energy harvesting has been proposed to overcome this problem. Over the past decade, the academia has produced thousands of papers on this topic, but it is still difficult to find a commercial sensor node operating solely with energy harvesting. One of the major reasons for this is the highly opportunistic and unreliable nature of the energy income from most of the available ambient energy sources. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a control loop enabling an energy harvesting sensor to request a recharge whenever needed. Energy-wise, the proposed method effectively transforms the operation mode of a passive wireless device from opportunistic to proactive, thus enabling an application to operate in a more predictable manner. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by implementing a real-life prototype Bluetooth Low Energy capable sensor node equipped with photovoltaic energy harvester, which can communicate and request a recharge from a commercial indoor smart lighting system.

We propose a system that optimizes both the number of beacons and their placement in a given environment. We propose a novel cost-function, called CovBSM, that allows to simultaneously optimize the 3-coverage while maximizing the beacon spreading. Using this cost function, we propose a framework that maximize both the number of beacons and their placement in a given environment.

Simon; Harwin, William			Detailed Examination of a Packet Collision Model for Bluetooth Low Energy Advertising Mode	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; packet collision analysis; Bluetooth low energy advertising mode	RELIABILITY; DIVERSITY	The aim of this paper is to investigate the amount of energy that is required to successfully transmit information inside the Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertising packets. There are applications that require more than one BLE node to simultaneously transmit data. The BLE protocol utilizes a specific communication method termed the advertising mode to perform unidirectional broadcasts of data from the advertising devices. However, with an increased number of BLE devices advertising simultaneously, there will be inevitable packet collisions from the advertising devices. This results in a waste of energy, specifically in low-power applications where lower consumption is desirable to minimize the need for battery replacements. This paper examines a packet collision model for the BLE advertising mode with the results validated using experimental data. Our analysis shows that when the throughput of the BLE network starts to fall due to an increase in the number of packet collisions, the energy consumption of the BLE nodes increases exponentially with respect to the number of nodes.

OperaBLE: An IoT-Based Wearable to Improve Efficiency and Smart Worker Care Services in Industry 4.0	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							OLDER-ADULTS; CONSTRUCTION; RECOGNITION; SENSORS; POSTURE	Industry 4.0 is leading the Fourth Industrial Revolution transforming traditional factories into smart factories governed by the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to assist smart factory employees, this paper introduces OperaBLE, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wearable proposal which is aimed at enhancing working conditions and efficiency in Industry 4.0 scenarios. We have developed two innovative algorithms for OperaBLE focused on power awareness as the key-enabling attribute towards success: Low-Frequency Movement Characterisation Algorithm (LoMoCA) and Adaptive Heart Rate Algorithm (AHRA). Novel experiments have been carried out using OperaBLE to determine its operability, reliability, and lifespan. Results obtained during experimentation demonstrate how OperaBLE empowers human-machine collaboration embedding workers in closed-loop performance and ensuring nonharmful working conditions by means of power-aware algorithms. OperaBLE is due to bring digitalisation into smart factories, playing an essential role in the emerging wearable revolution to arise in the following years towards smart production systems.

For easy and maintenance-free retrofitting an autonomous power supply is necessary. This work presents results on a foil-based inductive energy harvester as part of a condition monitoring system (system-on-a-foil) which can be retrofitted to pneumatic pistons. A maximum of 180 mu J of energy was generated with a single coil of the best layout for one motion cycle (back-and-forth motion) of the piston with a speed of 1 m/s. The total setup with five coils and an additional flux guide generates 1 mJ per motion cycle. This setup allows measuring the capacitor voltage and environmental data and transmitting them via bluetooth low energy to a portable device.

While not being designed directly for mesh operation, recent works have shown that both connected and broadcasts mesh are possible, this latter one being ultimately included in the standard. For any robust operation in a connected BLE mesh network, especially for high reliability and low-latency operations like healthcare, the control parameters need to be carefully chosen in order to avoid congestion and packet loss but the relationships between controllable parameters and final network performance have not yet been investigated in BLE mesh networks. In this work, we show that it is possible to infer the relationships between the controllable and observable network parameters by using a mutual information based structure learning approach; we show, in fact, how each setting such as transmit power, connection interval, source rate, impact overall network performance figures of merit such as end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and network build time.

The effects of the low voltage gain and resistive loading are reduced by using a process and temperature robust negative transconductor connected to the virtual ground.

J	Jebbawi, K; Egels, M; Pannier, P				Jebbawi, Khodor; Egels, Matthieu; Pannier, Philippe			Triple-Band Printed Dipole Antenna for RFID/GPS/BLE Applications	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M			English	Article								Progress in wireless communication requires antennas that work on multi-band simultaneously. This paper presents a design method for a multi-band antenna using printed dipole with L-slots fed by a single coaxial cable. Using this method, a triple-band antenna that operates at 868-915 MHz for RFID (radio frequency identification), 1575 MHz for GPS (global positioning system) and 2.45 GHz for BLE (bluetooth low energy) was designed and manufactured. The antenna's parameters for triple-band operation are investigated and discussed. In this antenna design, ANSYS HFSS software using highly accurate finite element method (FEM) simulation is employed to analyze the entire structure. The designed antenna is manufactured using an FR-4 substrate with a dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of 4.4 and thickness (h) of 1.6 mm. Many prototypes have been fabricated, and good agreement between simulations and measurements has been achieved. The performance of the prototypes has been measured in a standard far-field anechoic chamber. The proposed triple-band antenna is also tested by measuring the reading distance, and it is found that the proposed antenna can be used for RFID applications.

J	Wu, TY; Redoute, JM; Yuce, MR				Wu, Taiyang; Redoute, Jean-Michel; Yuce, Mehmet Rasit			A Wireless Implantable Sensor Design With Subcutaneous Energy Harvesting for Long-Term IoT Healthcare Applications	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Implantable biomedical device; energy harvesting; wireless communication; self-powered system; long-term healthcare	BATTERYLESS; PACEMAKER; SYSTEMS; DEVICES	In this paper, a wireless implantable sensor prototype with subcutaneous solar energy harvesting is proposed. To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliwatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm x 32 mm x 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 mu W in a 10 min operation cycle. With the subcutaneous solar energy harvester, the self-powered operation of the implantable sensor prototype is demonstrated by long-term experimental results. Two worst-case scenarios (no exposure to light and battery depletion) are considered with ex-vivo experiment simulations.

The traffic monitoring tasks are performed by analyzing strength of radio signal received by mobile devices from beacons that are placed on opposite sides of a road. This approach is suitable for crowd sourcing applications aimed at reducing travel time, congestion, and emissions. Advantages of the introduced method were demonstrated during experimental evaluation in real-traffic conditions. Results of the experimental evaluation confirm that the proposed solution is effective in detecting three classes of vehicles (personal cars, semitrucks, and trucks). Extensive experiments were conducted to test different classification approaches and data aggregation methods. In comparison with state-of-the-art RSSI-based vehicle detection methods, higher accuracy was achieved by introducing a dedicated ensemble of random forest classifiers with majority voting.

The proposed indoor positioning system utilizes 4 Estimote BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons to measure the user position with a smartphone. Each beacon broadcasts radio signal and a smartphone can receive these signals to estimate the distance by measuring RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values. In this paper, we proposed a new estimation algorithm to robustly calculate a user's position based on the strength of received signals. The proposed algorithm collects signals at a pre-processing stage to improve the quality of RSSI values, calculates the distance according to the signal strength from each beacon, and then estimates the user position with the triangulation of overlapped regions. The experimental result of our proposed indoor positioning system shows approximately 80% of accuracy within 2m error bound for three types of room. The proposed indoor position tracking is simple and well-suited with low-cost BLE beacons.

Railcars often take up to 24 hours to be processed through a railyard due to the need for manual inbound inspection, car classification, manual outbound inspection, and other intermediate processes. Much of the inspection and repair process has historically been completed manually with handwritten documents. Until recently, car inspections were rarely documented unless repairs were required. Currently, when a defect is detected in the yard, the railcar inspector must complete a "bad order" form that is adhered to each side of the car. This process may take up to ten minutes per bad order. To reduce labor costs and improve efficiency, asset management technology and Internet-of Things (IoT) frameworks can now be developed to reduce labor time needed to record bad orders, increase inspection visibility, and provide the opportunity to implement analytics and cognitive insights to optimize worker productivity and facilitate condition-based maintenance. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost prototype electronic freight car inspection tracking system for small-scale (short line and regional) railroad companies. This system allows car inspectors to record mechanical inspection data using a ruggedized mobile platform (e.g. tablet or smartphone). This data may then be used to improve inspection quality and efficiency as well as reduce inspection redundancy. Data collection will involve two approaches. The first approach is the development of an Android-based mobile application to electronically record and store inspection data using a smartphone or rugged tablet. This automates the entire bad order form process by connecting to IBM's Bluemix Cloudant NoSQL database. It allows for the information to be accessed by railroad mechanical managers or car owners, anywhere and at any time. The second approach is a web-based Machine-to-Machine (M2M) system using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and beacon technology to store car inspection data on a secure website and/or a cloudant database. This approach introduces the freight car inspection process to the "physical web," and it will offer numerous additional capabilities that are not possible with the current radio frequency identification device (RFID) system used for freight car tracking. By connecting railcars to the physical web, railcar specifications and inspection data can be updated in real-time and be made universally available. At the end of this paper, an evaluation and assessment is made of both the benefits and drawbacks of each of these approaches. The evaluation suggests that although some railroads may immediately benefit from these technological solutions, others may be better off with the current manual method until IoT and M2M become more universally accepted within the railroad industry. The primary value of this analysis is to provide a decision framework for railroads seeking to implement IoT systems in their freight car inspection practices. As an additional result, the software and IoT source code for the mobile app developed for this project will be open source to promote future collaboration within the industry.

In this paper, we study the effect of BLE protocols and channels on indoor positioning using different distance and similarity measures in a controlled environment. With the aim of reproducing a real positioning system situation, we also study the effect of the user's orientation in the positioning phase and, consequently, provide accuracy and precision results for each orientation. In a 168-m(2) testbed, 12 beacons configured to broadcast with the Eddystone and iBeacon protocols were deployed and 40 distance/similarity measures were considered. According to our results, in a specific orientation there is a group of distance metrics coupled with a protocol-channel combination that produces similar accuracy results. Therefore, choosing the right distance metric in that specific orientation is not as critical as choosing the right protocol and, especially, the right channel. There is a trend whereby the protocol-channel combination that provides the best accuracy is almost unique for each orientation. Depending on the orientation, the accuracies obtained for the abovementioned group of distances are within the range of 1.1-1.5 m and the precisions are 90% within the range of 1.5-2.5 m.

The power of the BLE signal is known to be highly unstable even when measurement conditions remain unchanged and statistics on repeated measurements are required in order to have a good confidence in the obtained short-range distance estimates. This work proposes a stack of corrections based on non-parametric and robust statistics as a preprocessing step on the measured data, such that both the calibration and the range estimation processes improve their accuracy. According to experiments, robust and non-parametric statistics are able to handle effectively the severe noise involved in RSSI measurements, reaching most of the times a sub-meter precision.

However, existing cattle shed management systems have not been suitable for small and medium-sized cattle sheds due to a short communication range and excessive power consumption as a result of the use of ZigBee-based wireless communication. Thus, the present paper designed a smart cattle shed system based on BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacon to improve power consumption.

However, regarding huge indoor place, there can be significant calculation problem issue due to a lot of cells to be pre-surveyed radio map and the great number of location anchor point such as beacon device. Furthermore, this can aggregate life time of user handheld devices which would be generally tiny shape and insufficient energy resource. In this paper, we present a new scheme which was researched with a unique goal for improving calculational computing power, with hibridizing traditional trilateration and recently issued fingerprinting approaches under the Bluetooth low energy environment. In addition, we also present experiment results with analytical evaluations to prove the performance of proposed scheme.

The platform exploits wearable sensors, a BT/BLE connectivity to the local gateway and then a connection, using standard formats and cyber-secure protocols, to a server-based application and repository. The platform allows clinicians and practitioners to realize aggravations and act promptly, before they become irreversible and lead to hospitalization. The system also implements data analysis, by processing multiple parameters in parallel. As well as monitoring the state of health, the proposed telemedicine platform can be also used to monitor the emotional and psychological state of the patient.

However, due to its simple communication protocol architecture, which broadcasts a static payload, a BLE beacon-based infrastructure is vulnerable to different types of abuses and attacks, in particular free-riding and device spoofing. Many beacon manufacturers propose dynamically randomizing beacon advertisement packets at the device firmware level as a solution. However, this approach is difficult to implement for already deployed beacon nodes as it requires a firmware update on each device. To alleviate these drawbacks, a crowd-assisted architecture for securing BLE beacons is proposed in this paper. A detailed architecture is presented along with experimental results and an implementation to demonstrate its feasibility. It is found that the beacon ID can be changed by user's mobile phone within a 20 m range with probability of almost 100% under both stationary and mobile conditions.

It is natural, because the physical layout in these applications is linear; it is suitable, because it supports the functionality of these applications, e.g. fast detection of convoy splits, network clustering, and routing between network nodes. In this paper, we propose an approach for the dynamic establishment and repair of an overlay line topology in wireless networks. To form this topology, only stable bidirectional links, i.e. links that are sufficiently reliable in both directions, are selected. For this purpose, we present an approach for the dynamic detection and statistical assessment of links. We have devised a protocol for both approaches, and have implemented, deployed, and tested this protocol on an industrial hardware platform using Bluetooth Low Energy.

Those who do that will be at the forefront, closing to become Smart Cities. To achieve this goal, we must evolve from an Internet of Things to an Internet of People, defined as an ecosystem where everyone and everything can sense the other and the world, and act upon such data and knowledge, aiming to enhance people's quality of life. Considering the Vulnerable Road Users' (VRUs) problem, this work provides a proof of concept on crowd sensing for urban security in Smart Cities, confirming that our concept is viable and has practical potential. The goal is to sense the density of people at certain points of interest for VRUs, such as pedestrian crossings or busier roads, by detecting Wi-Fi probe requests with a Smart Scanner. Such information can be relevant to many applications, allowing, for example, the promotion of better safety measures on crowed spots, enhance crowd control and assemble interesting insights on traffic characteristics. To complement this work, and considering that smart clothing will certainly play an important role in promoting the citizen sensor and the smart cities' approach to VRUs' safety, a case study will be presented and discussed in which their clothing is equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy transmitter. This allows such users to be recognized on the road, which may help avoid dangerous situations. The proof of concept was a success, with the developed software showing promising results at an extremely low price.

A Tripartite Filter Design for Seamless Pedestrian Navigation using Recursive 2-Means clustering and Tukey Update	2018 IEEE/ION POSITION, LOCATION AND NAVIGATION SYMPOSIUM (PLANS)	IEEE-ION Position Location and Navigation Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)	APR 23-26, 2018	Monterey, CA	IEEE, Inst Navigat, AESS		tripartite; modular; pedestrian navigation; Kalman; particle; filter; clustering; Tukey; adaptive		Mobile devices are desired to guide users seamlessly to diverse destinations indoors and outdoors. The positioning fixing subsystems often provide poor quality measurements with gaps in an urban environment. No single position fixing technology works continuously. Many sensor fusion variations have been previously trialed to overcome this challenge, including the particle filter that is robust and the Kalman filter which is fast. However, a lack exists, of context aware, seamless systems that are able to use the most fit sensors and methods in the correct context. A novel adaptive and modular tripartite navigation filter design is presented to enable seamless navigation. It consists of a sensor subsystem, a context inference and a navigation filter blocks. A foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning systems were used in the evaluation implementation of this design. A novel recursive 2-means clustering method was developed to track multiple hypotheses when there are gaps in position fixes. The closest hypothesis to a new position fix is selected when the gap ends. Moreover, when the position fix quality measure is not reliable, a fusion approach using a Tukey-style particle filter measurement update is introduced. Results show the successful operation of the design implementation. The Tukey update improves accuracy by 5% and together with the clustering method the system robustness is enhanced.

J	Sadowski, S; Spachos, P				Sadowski, Sebastian; Spachos, Petros			RSSI-Based Indoor Localization With the Internet of Things	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Indoor localization accuracy; power consumption; Internet of Things; RSSI; WiFi; Bluetooth low energy; Zigbee; LoRaWAN	SYSTEM	In the era of smart cities, there are a plethora of applications where the localization of indoor environments is important, from monitoring and tracking in smart buildings to proximity marketing and advertising in shopping malls. The success of these applications is based on the development of a cost-efficient and robust real-time system capable of accurately localizing objects. In most outdoor localization systems, global positioning system (GPS) is used due to its ease of implementation and accuracy up to five meters. However, due to the limited space that comes with performing localization of indoor environments and the large number of obstacles found indoors, GPS is not a suitable option. Hence, accurately and efficiently locating objects is a major challenge in indoor environments. Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) along with novel wireless technologies can alleviate the problem. Small-size and cost-efficient IoT devices which use wireless protocols can provide an attractive solution. In this paper, we compare four wireless technologies for indoor localization: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11n-2009 at the 2.4 GHz band), Bluetooth low energy, Zigbee, and long-range wide-area network. These technologies are compared in terms of localization accuracy and power consumption when IoT devices are used. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from each modality were used and trilateration was performed for localization. The RSSI data set is available online. The experimental results can be used as an indicator in the selection of a wireless technology for an indoor localization system following application requirements.

A between-group experimental design with 114 participants was conducted to test three groups; (1) a group using the mobile guide application as an information aid, (2) a control group (with no information aid), and (3) a group using pamphlets to explore the KOG. The Museum Experience Scale (MES) was used to evaluate visitors' experience for all participants, whilst the Multimedia Guide Scale (MMGS) was used to evaluate the visitors' experience with the mobile guide group. The most notable result from the Museum Experience Scale (MES) showed an impact on the visitors in terms of knowledge and learning when using the mobile guide application. However, the study found that enhancing visitors experience goes beyond simply providing interactive technologies in public settings to aid with information delivery. A limitation was providing relevant information in a timely and seamless manner due to inaccuracies of mapping between physical and digital environments. Future works should consider beacons and other Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to address the issues with location based devices. It is also important to highlight that the use of one's own device had a significant impact on learnability and control of the device, thus suggesting that the BYOD concept should be widely used in informal educational settings implementing mobile guide applications. The use of MES and MMGS informs future researches with an understanding of the different dimensions of visitors' experiences with mobile guide technology in public spaces to inform mobile application development that may further boost visitors' engagement, emotional connection, and meaningful experience.

For this, green I3A smart factory (GreenISF) scenario is presented, where the deployment of a collaborative mesh network based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and long range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) technologies promotes human-machine collaboration towards socially sustainable factories. In order to encourage human-centric architectures in such environments, our smart wristband prototype OperaBLE is introduced in this paper as key enabler for human-in-the-loop systems. Thus, the network deployed in GreenISF is composed of body area networks which monitor labor activity and reinforce security at work by embedding sensors in regulatory industrial clothes. These networks cooperate with our BLE mesh infrastructure aimed to fulfill the major challenges Industry 4.0: zero fails, total coverage, and sustainability. Furthermore, a context information network based on LoRaWAN complements our mesh network to provide the system with valuable environmental data and prevent operators from harmful workplaces. The system is connected to a fog server responsible for preprocessing raw data that will be stored in a global cloud server. The experiments carried out highlight the contribution of OperaBLE towards safer working conditions and a sustainable digitalization of Industry 4.0.

Although the BLE standard defines advanced security mechanisms, there are known security attacks for BLE and BLE-enabled field devices must be tested thoroughly against these attacks. This article identifies the possible attacks for BLE-enabled field devices relevant for industrial automation. It also presents a framework for defining and executing BLE security attacks and evaluates it on three BLE devices. All tested devices are vulnerable and this confirms that there is a need for better security testing tools as well as for additional defense mechanisms for BLE devices.

In addition, security features are required to secure data transmitted between the end devices and the server. In this study, we developed a secure multiprotocol gateway that supports for RF, ZigBee, BLE, and Ethernet protocols and utilizes TCP / IP protocols for advanced data processing after the gateway exit. Additionally, we added a data encryption algorithm for data security transmitted through the proposed gateway. To display the data the server receives, we added a dashboard to the gateway. The proposed multiprotocol gateway has been simulated using testbed environment in which the transmitted data was encrypted by default. The results showed that WiFi has the highest throughput compared to BLE and XBee, while the transmission delay tends to increase for all protocols but WiFi has the lowest delay compared to XBee and BLE.

However, the beacon technology can only provide one-way communication. If we need the smartphones to respond to the beacon messages, the smartphone users have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. In some cases the mobile Internet services may not be always available. Therefore, we develop an interactive positioning and tracking system based solely on the BLE technology. Specifically, we make the beacon devices capable of two-way communication. On one hand, our beacon devices can detect the presence of a specific customer at specific locations, and then the presence information can be sent to the application server via the BLE mesh network consisting of beacon devices. On the other hand, the application server can send a personalized location-based message to the customer, again via the relay of beacon devices. The benefit of our system is two-fold: not only the customers without Internet connections can enjoy the positioning services, but also the backend system can be aware of the presence of specific customers and track their real-time locations. Experimental results showed that our system is practicable with moderate transmission latencies in the BLE mesh network.

Event-driven applications achieve power lower than 240nW from a 0.75V supply while latency-critical systems wake up in almost 200 mu s at a 230 mu W consumption. A within-bit LC oscillator duty-cycling scheme is proposed to provide an extra 24% power reduction.

The proposed architecture improves the efficiency of the conventional constant-supply switching PAs by a factor of 3 in low power mode, resulting in power saving of nearly 1mW at -10dBm output power. The TX benefits from a compact 0.1mm(2) PLL operating with an IPN of 0.83 degrees at 2.4GHz and spot phase noise of -119.4dBc/Hz at 3MHz offset. The chip is fabricated in a 40nm LP CMOS process with a die area of 0.7mm(2). The proposed transmitter consumes 6.1mW at 3dBm output power in BLE mode and 1.6mW at -10dBm for BAN applications, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported power consumption among the BLE transmitters in similar process node.

J	Leonardi, L; Patti, G; Lo Bello, L				Leonardi, Luca; Patti, Gaetano; Lo Bello, Lucia			Multi-Hop Real-Time Communications Over Bluetooth Low Energy Industrial Wireless Mesh Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; industrial wireless sensor networks; real-time; wireless mesh networks	MANAGEMENT; DISCOVERY; SYSTEM; BLE	Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are used to acquire sensor data that need real-time processing, therefore they require predictable behavior and real-time guarantees. To be cost effective, IWSNs are also expected to be low cost and low power. In this context, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology, as it allows implementing low-cost industrial networks. As BLE is a short-range technology, a multihop mesh network is needed to cover a large area. Nevertheless, the recently published Bluetooth mesh networking specifications do not provide support for real-time communications over multihop mesh networks. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the multihop real-time BLE (MRT-BLE) protocol, a real-time protocol developed on top of BLE, that allows for bounded packet delays over mesh networks. MRT-BLE also provides priority support. This paper describes in detail the MRT-BLE protocol and how to implement it on commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Two kinds of performance evaluation for the MRT-BLE protocol are provided. The first one is a worst case end-to-end delay analysis, while the second one is based on the experimental results obtained through measurements on a real testbed.

Hence, performance improvement during the discovery process has become one of major concerns. In BLE networks, advertisement interval of advertiser directly influences the performance, such as discovery latency and energy consumption. Frequent transmissions of advertising packet may result in collisions and serious energy consumption. On the contrary, larger advertisement interval may lead to delayed device discovery. In this paper we propose an algorithm to dynamically adjust its advertisement interval considering the network conditions based on a carrier sensing (CS) scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance compared with basic CS scheme and BLE standard in crowded BLE networks.

J	Cha, SC; Chen, JF; Su, CH; Yeh, KH				Cha, Shi-Cho; Chen, Jyun-Fu; Su, Chunhua; Yeh, Kuo-Hui			A Blockchain Connected Gateway for BLE-Based Devices in the Internet of Things	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Blockchain; bluetooth low energy; Internet of Things (IoT); security; privacy		Recently, the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a rapid development and significant advancement of ubiquitous applications seamlessly integrated within our daily life. Owing to the accompanying growth of the importance of privacy, a great deal of attention has focused on the issues of secure management and robust access control of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.

Among these technology, the UWB provides features of a low power consumption and high positioning accuracy caused by good immunity to multi-path fading. However, the performance of positioning feature is deteriorated in non-line of sight (NLOS) channel. Therefore, the identification of non-line of sight (NLOS) in UWB channel is required to verify and enhance the effects of UWB positioning. In this paper, we identify NLOS by measuring signal strengths on the first path and multi-path and estimate the distance from UWB anchor to a tag in through-the-wall and hard-NLOS channels. The results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently identified NLOS in UWB channel environments.

Recent systems employ short range wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth etc. WiFi is a suitable solution when an existing network is available in a field, and IEEE 802.15.4 is employed in mesh networks. Bluetooth attracts attention in smartphone sensing because it is suitable to reduce power consumption in mobile devices. Smartphone sensing is a new data collection scheme. Smartphone sensing application usually consumes energy to collect data continuously because it runs as a background process. Therefore, users request smart data collection scheme to reduce excessive consumption of energy and to avoid the conscious operation of the application. This paper develops Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based automated data collection scheme in agricultural measurement system. The developed scheme utilizes a smartphone to realize automated measurement information collection from sensor devices. The demonstrations show the special BLE based sensor device, a data collection application, and a browsing application.

People are worried about ubiquitous IoT devices collecting and sharing their data with unknown parties without their awareness or consent. Currently, several governmental agencies have stated that IoT service providers should obtain user consent before collecting and using their personal data. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no standard means for users to reach agreements on privacy practices for IoT applications. Among different types of IoT applications, this paper focuses on the scenario in which people use their personal smartphones to access nearby IoT devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To address the privacy issue in the scenario, this paper proposes a privacy preferences expression framework for BLE-based applications named PrivacyBat. The framework defines specifications for users to achieve agreements on privacy practices with nearby BLE devices. In addition, this framework provides guidelines for a device to process user requests according to the agreement. To demonstrate how the framework operates, this paper further provides a proof of concept implementation. As the proposed framework can improve the privacy policy agreement process in IoT applications, this paper can hopefully contribute to increasing user trust in IoT applications.

The fast discovery of all BLE advertisers is one of the most challenging tasks in supporting such a large number of BLE-enabled services successfully. However, there has been no research published so far that presents a method of setting parameters that provide the best performance in the BLE neighbor discovery process. In this paper, we propose a method to determine an optimal value for the BLE advertisement interval to minimize the time in which all surrounding BLE advertisers are discovered by a scanner. To obtain the optimal advertisement interval, we derive a new analytical model to characterize the BLE discovery time with all possible parameters. We also analyze the effect of the optimal advertisement interval on energy consumption. The analytical model is validated by comparing the analysis results with the simulations. The simulation results show that the optimal advertisement interval for a given number of BLE advertisers can minimize the discovery time, and the energy consumption also is reduced significantly.

These could be jeopardized by their wandering behavior. Mobile applications that focus on health care have received special interest from medical specialists. These applications have been widely accepted, due to the availability of smart devices that include sensors. However, sensor-based applications are highly energy demanding and as such, they can be unaffordable in mobile e-health control due to battery constraints., is paper presents the design and implementation of a platform aimed at providing support in e-health control and provision of location services for wandering patients through real-time medical and mobility information analysis. The platform includes a configurable mobile application for heart rate and stress level monitoring based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE), and a web service for monitoring and control of the wandering patients. Due to battery limitations of smart devices with sensors, the mobile application includes energy-efficient handling and transmission policies to make more efficient the transmission of medical information from the sensor-based smart device to the web service. In turn, the web service provides e-health control services for patients and caregivers. Through the platform functionality, caregivers (and patients) can receive notifications and suggestions in response to emergency, contingency situations, or deviations from health and mobility patterns of the wandering patients., is paper describes a platform that conceals continuous monitoring with energy-efficient applications in favor of e-health control of wandering patients.

J	Zhang, QY; Chen, GL; Chang, CY; Chen, CC				Zhang, Qiaoyun; Chen, Guilin; Chang, Chih-Yung; Chen, Cheng-Chang			MATR: A Mobility-Aware Topology Restructuring Scheme for Bluetooth Body Area Networks	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Mobility; Transmission delay; Wearable; BANs	LOW-ENERGY; TECHNOLOGY; SCATTERNET; CAPACITY	Bluetooth low energy technology has gradually penetrated into people's daily life. Nowadays, a number of wearable devices which are embedded with tiny sensors and Bluetooth radio can create a Bluetooth body area networks (BANs). Because of human mobility, the signal strength of Bluetooth links might be decreased with the link distance, increasing the transmission delay and hence dropping the network throughputs. Considering the mobility issue, this paper presents a mobility-aware topology restructuring scheme, called MATR, for Bluetooth body area networks. The proposed MATR mechanism changes the piconet topology for redirecting the traffic flow to the links with better quality. In addition, the proposed mechanism is also extended to restructure the topology of a scatternet, further reducing the transmission delay of link connecting different Piconets. Performance study reveals that the proposed MATR approaches further reduce the transmission delay and the energy consumption for Bluetooth BANs, decrease the network overheads raised by packet retransmissions, and improve the network throughput of Bluetooth radio area networks.

The QL antenna is a very thin single-layer groundless structure which allows for the installation of neighboring electronics and sensors which need to be extremely close to the epidermis layer. The performance of the proposed antennas was investigated for three main standards: GSM-900, GSM-1800, and Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Radiation pattern measurements were conducted to compare their results with their simulation counterparts. Moreover, data communication tests showed that the acquired BER readings could qualify the BLE and GSM-900 antennas to work as part of 4-QAM wireless links. Besides these hands-on endeavors, an equivalent and more efficient mathematical model of biological tissues which make up the human arm was computed. The equivalent model was tested in software and has the practical potential to be realized in physical phantom making.

Miniaturized Printed Inverted-F Antenna for Internet of Things: A Design on PCB with a Meandering Line and Shorting Strip	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article							RF FRONT-END; SMART CITIES; BAND; HANDSETS; SYSTEM; MODULE; PIFA	This paper focuses on a printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) with meandering line and meandering shorting strip under 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band for Internet of things (IoT) applications. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is one of potential platforms and technologies for IoT applications under ISM band. Printed circuit board (PCB) antenna commonly used in commercial and medical applications because of its small size, low profile, and low cost compared to low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology. The proposed structure of PIFA is implemented on PCB to gain all these advantages. Replacing conventional PCB line in PIFA by the meandering line and meandering shorting strip improves the efficiency of the PIFA as well as the bandwidth. As a case study, design and measurement results of the proposed PIFA are presented.	[Cheung, Cheuk Yin] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yuen, Joseph S.

To ensure that the proposed low power transceiver can operate at 1 Mbps data rate, FSK modulation is implemented using an ADPLL with direct modulation technique. The SPDT switch is integrated to share the antenna and matching network between the transmitter and receiver, thus minimizing the system cost by reducing external components. The transceiver is implemented using 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology. The die area of the transceiver with DC-DC converter is 1.79 mm(2). The power consumption of the Tx and Rx are 6 and 5 mW, respectively. The noise figure of Rx is up to 6.8 dB with respect to channel frequencies. The phase noise of the ADPLL is -84.7 and -118.9 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 1 MHz offset from 2.44 GHz, respectively.

The first project senses physiological signals; namely, photoplethysmograph (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and skin temperature (SKT), in a design that is low cost, low power, and embedded in a non intrusive wristband form factor. These wearable sensors are capable of physiological monitoring, which is important when detecting implicit communication cues related to emotions and affective expressions such that affective computing is possible [1]. The device transmits data wirelessly to a PC using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. A related computer interaction has been developed to teach words to students, while monitoring their physiological signals to classify engagement. The second project aims to provide occupant specific energy feedback in real-time. To do so, it is necessary to gather information about how each occupant is using energy (i.e., how much electricity they use on a daily basis). Therefore, a sensor was designed with the capabilities of detecting energy-related events, confirming the energy-related events using a proximity sensing technique, and being small enough to be worn or carried around during day-to-day activities. The printed circuit board (PCB) designs of both projects are summarized.

Currently available indoor positioning technologies differ in terms of accuracy, costs and effort, but have improved quickly in the last couple of years. It has been actively conducted research for estimating indoor location using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) level of Wi-Fi access points or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags. WiFi signal is commonly used for the indoor positioning technology. However, It requires an external power source, more setup costs and expensive. BLE is inexpensive, small, have a long battery life and do not require an external energy source. Therefore, using BLE tags we might be able to make the positioning system practical and inexpensive way. In this paper, we investigate such practical type of indoor positioning method based on BLE. BLE RSSI are processed by Multilayer Perceptron(MLP). Also, compass data and walking speed estimation with an extended Kalman filter is used to improve the accuracy. Our preliminary experimental result shows 2.21m error in case of the MLP output. In preliminary experimental results, the proposed approach improved the accuracy of indoor positioning by 21.2%.

It is estimated that the number of connected devices will exceed 20 billions in 2020, and machine-to-machine (M2M) devices will account for nearly half of total connected devices. However, existing cellular systems and wireless standards, designed primarily for human-to-human (H2H) communications focusing on reducing access latency, increasing data rate, and system throughput, are not well suited for M2M communications that require massive connections, diverse QoS requirements, and low energy consumption. Radio resource management (RRM) in conventional H2H communications aims at improving spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Similarly, RRM also plays a vital role in M2M communications. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art research activities on RRM in M2M communications. First, we discuss the issues on RRM for machine-type communications in LTE/LTE-A cellular networks including access control, radio resource allocation, power management, and the latest 3GPP standards supporting M2M communications. Acknowledging the fact that a single technology can not support all M2M applications, we discuss RRM issues for unlicensed band radio access technologies in M2M capillary networks, including IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth low energy, ZigBee, and smart metering networks. We also survey M2M RRM methods in heterogeneous networks consisting of cellular networks, capillary networks, and ultra dense networks.

Design and Practical Evaluation of a Family of Lightweight Protocols for Heterogeneous Sensing through BLE Beacons in IoT Telemetry Applications	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE; beacon; lightweight protocol; plug-and-play; smart sensors; IoT; WoT; telemetry; Eddystone	SMART CITIES; INTERNET; THINGS; ENERGY	The Internet of Things (IoT) involves a wide variety of heterogeneous technologies and resource-constrained devices that interact with each other. Due to such constraints, IoT devices usually require lightweight protocols that optimize the use of resources and energy consumption. Among the different commercial IoT devices, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based beacons, which broadcast periodically certain data packets to notify their presence, have experienced a remarkable growth, specially due to their application in indoor positioning systems. This article proposes a family of protocols named Lightweight Protocol for Sensors (LP4S) that provides fast responses and enables plug-and-play mechanisms that allow IoT telemetry systems to discover new nodes and to describe and auto-register the sensors and actuators connected to a beacon. Thus, three protocols are defined depending on the beacon hardware characteristics: LP4S-6 (for resource-constraint beacons), LP4S-X (for more powerful beacons) and LP4S-J (for beacons able to run complex firmware). In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the designed protocols, the most restrictive (LP4S-6) is tested after implementing it for a telemetry application in a beacon based on Eddystone (Google's open beacon format). Thus, the beacon specification is extended in order to increase its ability to manage unlimited sensors in a telemetry system without interfering in its normal operation with Eddystone frames. The performed experiments show the feasibility of the proposed solution and its superiority, in terms of latency and energy consumption, with respect to approaches based on Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) when multiple users connect to a mote or in scenarios where latency is not a restriction, but where low-energy consumption is essential.

A low power multi-step Ph-ADC for zero intermediate frequency (IF) GFSK receivers as defined in Bluetooth low energy protocol is proposed in this paper. With dedicatedly designed binary code scheme and multi-step operation, the Ph-ADC requires only 52 current elements and one comparator, in contrast to the design in literature using 260 current elements and 8 comparators. Non-idealities due to transconductance errors and offset errors are theoretically analyzed, followed by a design strategy to minimize trip point errors. Simulation results show that the digital intensive Ph-ADC consumes only 7.9 mu A current from a 1.8 V supply when implemented in a 180 nm CMOS process. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the maximum trip point error is only 2.3A degrees, which is less than 1/8 least significant bit. When the Ph-ADC is used in a GFSK demodulator, the required IF E-b/N-0 is 13.5 dB to achieve a bit error rates of 0.1%.

Printed, metallic thermoelectric generators integrated with pipe insulation for powering wireless sensors	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Thermoelectric generator; Screen printing; Internet of things; Pipe insulation; Wireless sensing network	FILMS; POLYMER	Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with advanced analytics, is poised to revolutionize manufacturing maintenance and efficiency. However, a practical route to powering these many IoT devices remains unclear. In this work, flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are fabricated from low cost, screen printed silver and nickel inks before being integrated into a novel form factor device based on commercial steam pipe insulation. Through optimization of internal resistances and total device design, this 420-junction TEG device produces 308 mu W of power at a temperature difference of 127 K. This is sufficient to power a temperature sensing circuit with wireless communication capabilities. In this report we demonstrate that, after an initial 4 h of charging, this TEG can power a standard RFduino microcontroller for 10 min while sending temperature readings every 30 s via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a cell phone. Additional optimization and scaling could further increase system efficiency and provide a viable route to powering an industrial wireless sensing network (WSN).

However, there are still plenty of challenges related to this technology, especially in terms of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations due to the behaviour of the channels and the multipath effect, that lead to poor precision. In order to mitigate these effects, in this paper we propose and implement a real Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy, that improves accuracy while reducing power consumption and costs. The three main proposals are: frequency diversity, Kalman filtering and a trilateration method what we have denominated "weighted trilateration". The analysis of the results proves that all the proposals improve the precision of the system, which goes up to 1.82 m 90% of the time for a device moving in a middle-size room and 0.7 m for static devices. Furthermore, we have proved that the system is scalable and efficient in terms of cost and power consumption. The implemented approach allows using a very simple device (like a SensorTag) on the items to locate. The system enables a very low density of anchor points or references and with a precision better than existing solutions.

In this context, wireless transmission plays a key role, and among available solutions, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining more and more popularity. BLE merges together good performance, low-energy consumption and widespread diffusion. The aim of this work is to review the main methodologies adopted to investigate BLE performance. The first part of this review is an in-depth description of the protocol, highlighting the main characteristics and implementation details. The second part reviews the state of the art on BLE characteristics and performance. In particular, we analyze throughput, maximum number of connectable sensors, power consumption, latency and maximum reachable range, with the aim to identify what are the current limits of BLE technology. The main results can be resumed as follows: throughput may theoretically reach the limit of similar to 230 kbps, but actual applications analyzed in this review show throughputs limited to similar to 100 kbps; the maximum reachable range is strictly dependent on the radio power, and it goes up to a few tens of meters; the maximum number of nodes in the network depends on connection parameters, on the network architecture and specific device characteristics, but it is usually lower than 10; power consumption and latency are largely modeled and analyzed and are strictly dependent on a huge number of parameters. Most of these characteristics are based on analytical models, but there is a need for rigorous experimental evaluations to understand the actual limits.

We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called "smart case" has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could be comparable to medical grade devices.	[Mahmud, Md. Shaad; Wang, Honggang; Esfar-E-Alam, A.

A 2.4-GHz, Hybrid 10-Mb/s BPSK Backscatter and 1-Mb/s FSK Bluetooth TX With Hardware Reuse	IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS COMPONENTS LETTERS			English	Article						Backscatter communication; backscatter; Bluetooth low energy (BLE); hardware reuse		This letter presents a hybrid architecture for wireless transmitters that reuses the same hardware and antenna to selectively operate in either backscatter or conventional modes, with a minimum of added complexity. A single FET stage is used as both a Class-C power amplifier for a conventional 2.4-GHz, 1-Mb/s frequency shift keying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmitter with peak efficiency eta approximate to 78%, as well as a 10-Mb/s BPSK modulator in an ultralow power backscatter mode. A transmitter energy consumption of 81 nJ/b at an output power level of + 14 dBm is achieved in the 1-Mb/s conventional mode, while only 32 pJ/b is required in the 10-Mb/s BPSK backscatter mode. It is shown that the data rate of the backscatter mode can be decoupled from the conventional mode, such that the backscatter link can operate at ten times the rate of the conventional link, while achieving over three orders of magnitude power savings.

J	Park, J; Yang, XY; Cho, YK; Seo, J				Park, JeeWoong; Yang, Xiaoyu; Cho, Yong K.; Seo, Jongwon			Improving dynamic proximity sensing and processing for smart work-zone safety	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Work-zone safety; Proximity sensing; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Construction equipment; Mobile device	CONSTRUCTION SITES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Equipment/vehicles striking workers is one of the most frequent accidents that occur in roadway workzones. As a means of prevention, a number of active technologies have been developed to provide proximity sensing and alerts for workers and equipment operators. However, most of these systems are based on the distance/proximity level between workers and equipment and neglect the variations caused by different settings and environmental conditions, such as equipment types and approaching speeds, which can result in inconsistency and delay of the systems. As of yet, previous research has insufficiently investigated these issues. This research addresses the issues by utilizing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based proximity sensing and alert system developed by the authors. This paper discusses the development and assessment of parameter adjustment and adaptive signal processing (ASP) methods. The research conducted field trials in various dynamic conditions and settings to assess the performance of the system. The test results showed that the parameter adjustment function reduced the inconsistency of the alert distances resulting from different types of equipment, and that the ASP method reduced the time delay resulting from high approaching speeds. The developed proximity safety alerts system provides stakeholders with better understanding of dynamic spatial relationships among equipment, operator, workers, and a surrounding work environment; thus, improving construction work zone safety.

Identification and distance estimation of users and objects by means of electronic beacons in social robotics	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electronic beacons; Social robots; Human-robot interaction; Bluetooth Low Energy; User identification; Object identification	COMMUNICATION; PLATFORM; SYSTEM	Social robots are intended to coexist and to communicate with humans in a natural way. This requires these robots to be able to identify people (and objects) around them to use that information during human-robot dialogs. In this work we present how electronic beacons can benefit the interactions between humans and social robots. In particular, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy beacons are presented as the most suitable option, among the up-to-date available technologies. In order to show the advantages of the system during human-robot interaction, first, we present the integration of the information provided by these devices in the robot's dialog system; and after, a hidden toy hunt game is described as a case study of a scenario where electronic beacons ease the interaction between humans and a social robot.

The trainability of brain rhythm using a neurofeedback system is uncertainty because various experimental designs are used in previous studies. The current study aimed to develop a portable wireless NFT system for alpha rhythm and to validate effect of the NFT system on memory with a sham-controlled group. Methods: The proposed system contained an EEG signal analysis device and a smartphone with wireless Bluetooth low-energy technology. Instantaneous 1-s EEG power and contiguous 5-min EEG power throughout the training were developed as feedback information. The training performance and its progression were kept to boost usability of our device. Participants were blinded and randomly assigned into either the control group receiving random 4-Hz power or Alpha group receiving 8-12-Hz power. Working memory and episodic memory were assessed by the backward digital span task and word-pair task, respectively. Results: The portable neurofeedback system had advantages of a tiny size and long-term recording and demonstrated trainability of alpha rhythm in terms of significant increase of power and duration of 8-12 Hz. Moreover, accuracies of the backward digital span task and word-pair task showed significant enhancement in the Alpha group after training compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our tiny portable device demonstrated success trainability of alpha rhythm and enhanced two kinds of memories.

J	Sun, FM; Yi, CF; Li, WN; Li, Y				Sun, Fangmin; Yi, Chenfu; Li, Weinan; Li, Ye			A wearable H-shirt for exercise ECG monitoring and individual lactate threshold computing	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						H-shirt; Wearable; Exercise ECG; Lactate threshold; Accurate	QRS-DETECTION; SENSORS; SYSTEM; COMPRESSION; ACQUISITION; SMARTPHONE; ELECTRODES; PLATFORM	Millions of people worldwide are involved in daily physical exercise and fitness, which implies the growing demand for wearable devices and gadgets monitoring these activities. To ensure the comfort of exercise, wearable health monitoring devices are the most lucrative for real-time and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, which is essential for making individualized fitness plans and avoiding the occurrence of cardiac arrest. Moreover, the ECG monitoring data obtained are instrumental in the computation of the individual lactate threshold heart rate, which is the inflection point of the heart rate-time curve and indicates the exercise intensity level, at which the blood concentration of lactate and lactic acid begins to exponentially increase and will result in overstraining, unless the exercise efforts (running speed or muscle intensity) are temporarily reduced. The respective monitoring and overstrain warning devices have a large potential for the individual assessment of the endurance performance, as well as for prescribing intensities in the endurance training. However, the common drawbacks of commercial wearable devices used in healthcare and medical fields for continuous monitoring of ECG, electroencephalogram, respiration, temperature, SpO(2), and human activity, such as smart helmets, wearable patches, and activity-tracking bands, are motion artifacts and unstable skin-electrode contact, which jeopardize the accurate measurements during exercise. Given this, the Health shirt (H-shirt) integrated with conductive fabric ECG electrodes enabling the accurate ECG monitoring during physical exercise has been introduced and validated by the authors. In this paper, the modified design of the sports H-shirt with the lactate threshold heart rate computing is proposed and implemented. High elasticity of the H-shirt not only ensures a stable skin-electrode contact but also avoids the discomfort caused by the measurement. A highly integrated printed circuit board is used to filter, amplify, digitalize, and transmit the ECG signal sampled from the electrodes, while a high input impedance amplifier circuit is designed to improve its signal-to-noise ratio. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as the data transmission protocol between the H-shirt and the mobile phone. A mobile phone-based ECG analysis and exercise evaluation platform have been developed, which allow one to detect six types of abnormal ECG (tachycardia, bradycardia, a dropped beat, premature beat, bigeminy, and trigeminy) and individual lactate threshold, as well as to provide real-time health warning and exercise optimization hints through mobile phone Voice messages. Being powered by a 150 mAh 3.7 V lithium battery, the H-shirt operated for at least 24 h and was tested on four volunteers of both genders and age from 14 to 32 years, whose ECG and the lactate threshold heart rate values were accurately measured during their test exercise on a treadmill with running speed up to 16 km/h and used as a reference for the users to adjust their exercise intensity. The available options of adding sensors for measurement of more physiological parameters by the proposed sports H-shirt make it quite lucrative for the rehabilitation exercise monitoring.

J	Ceron, JD; Lopez, DM; Ramirez, GA				Ceron, Jesus D.; Lopez, Diego M.; Ramirez, Gustavo A.			A mobile system for sedentary behaviors classification based on accelerometer and location data	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						Sedentary behaviors classification; Data mining; Sensor mining; Accelerometer; BLE beacons	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY	Background: Sedentary behaviors are associated to the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Accelerometers and inclinometers have been used to estimate sedentary behaviors, however a major limitation is that these devices do not provide enough contextual information in order to recognize the specific sedentary behavior performed, e.g., sitting or lying watching TV, using the PC, sitting at work, driving, etc. Objective: Propose and evaluate the precision of a mobile system for objectively measuring six sedentary behaviors using accelerometer and location data. Results: The system is implemented as an Android Mobile App, which identifies individual's sedentary behaviors based on accelerometer data taken from the smartphone or a smartwatch, and symbolic location data obtained from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The system infers sedentary behaviors by means of a supervised Machine Learning Classifier. The precision of the classification of five of the six studied sedentary behaviors exceeded 95% using accelerometer data from a smartwatch attached to the wrist and 98% using accelerometer data from a smartphone put into the pocket. Statistically significant improvement in the average precision of the classification due to the use of BLE beacons was found by comparing the precision of the classification using accelerometer data only, and BLE beacons localization technology. Conclusions: The proposed system provides contextual information of specific sedentary behaviors by inferring with very high precision the physical location where the sedentary event occurs. Moreover, it was found that, when accelerometers are put in the user's pocket, instead of the wrist and, when symbolic location is inferred using BLE beacons; the precision in the classification is improved. In practice, the proposed system has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the context and determinants of sedentary behaviors, necessary for the implementation and monitoring of personalized noncommunicable diseases prevention programs, for instance, sending sedentary behavior alerts, or providing personalized recommendations on physical activity. The system could be used at work to promote active breaks and healthy habits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We track the position of a moving sensor by integrating highly unreliable and noisy BLE observations streaming from multiple locations. A novel aspect of our approach is the development of an observation model, specifically tailored for received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprints: a combination based on the optimal transport model of Wasserstein distance. The tracking results of the entire system are compared with alternative baseline estimation methods, such as nearest neighboring fingerprints and an artificial neural network. Our results show that highly accurate estimation from noisy Bluetooth data is practically feasible with an observation model based on Wasserstein distance interpolation combined with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for tracking.

Off-Body Antenna Wireless Performance Evaluation in a Residential Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article						Antenna radiation patterns; bluetooth low energy; body sensor networks; body-centric communications; indoor communication; Internet of Things; microstrip antennas	PATCH ANTENNA; 868 MHZ; PROPAGATION; CHANNEL; COMMUNICATION; INTERNET; SYSTEMS; THINGS; GHZ	Modern body-centric communication systems require good link quality. Antenna performance is of primary importance when meeting this requirement. This paper contributes a method suited to the difficult task of quantifying antenna performance in a body-centric communications system. In a case study, a planar wrist wearable antenna, which provides radiation pattern switching across the 2.4 GHz operating band through an innovative technique that does not require an additional switching mechanism, is benchmarked against a monopole and a patch antenna in a residential setting. The performance of the antenna and subsequently the benefits of the pattern-switching technique are successfully quantified. The holistic method includes both antenna measurements and channel simulation with ray tracing. Results are verified against real-world measurements.

Through minimizing parasitic capacitance and maximizing the main inductance, the DCO can mitigate initial oscillation conditions with low supply voltage. The proposed design procedure focuses on how to optimize switched capacitors and their number in capacitor banks within the specifications. A small number of switched capacitors can reduce parasitics and power consumption. The proposed DCO is fabricated using a 55-nm 1P6M CMOS process and meets the specifications of BLE with 0.68-mW power consumption. The phase noise of the DCO is -114.2 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz at 4.96 GHz. The tuning range of the DCO is set to 4.5-5.3 GHz, which is sufficient to support BLE applications despite the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.

J	Cha, SC; Yeh, KH; Chen, JF				Cha, Shi-Cho; Yeh, Kuo-Hui; Chen, Jyun-Fu			Toward a Robust Security Paradigm for Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Smart Objects in the Internet-of-Things	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; internet-of-things; privacy; random address; security	SYSTEM	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. In BLE-based IoT applications, e.g., wearables-oriented service applications, the Bluetooth MAC addresses of devices will be swapped for device pairings. The random address technique is adopted to prevent malicious users from tracking the victim's devices with stationary Bluetooth MAC addresses and accordingly the device privacy can be preserved. However, there exists a tradeoff between privacy and security in the random address technique. That is, when device pairing is launched and one device cannot actually identify another one with addresses, it provides an opportunity for malicious users to break the system security via impersonation attacks. Hence, using random addresses may lead to higher security risks. In this study, we point out the potential risk of using random address technique and then present critical security requirements for BLE-based IoT applications. To fulfill the claimed requirements, we present a privacy-aware mechanism, which is based on elliptic curve cryptography, for secure communication and access-control among BLE-based IoT objects. Moreover, to ensure the security of smartphone application associated with BLE-based IoT objects, we construct a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework (SCIRM) which enables smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of BLE-based applications of interest with smart contracts.

More specifically, we focus on the scenario where one of the persons of interest is unable or unwilling to carry a smartphone, or any other wearable device, which frequently arises in caregiver/cared-for situations. We consider the case of indoor spaces populated with anonymous binary sensors (Passive Infrared motion sensors) and eponymous wearable sensors (smartphones interacting with Estimote beacons), and we propose a solution to the resulting sensor-fusion problem. Using a data set with sensor readings collected from one-person and two-person sessions engaged in a variety of activities of daily living, we investigate the relative merits of relying solely on anonymous sensors, solely on eponymous sensors, or on their combination. We examine how the lack of synchronization across different sensing sources impacts the quality of location estimates, and discuss how it could be mitigated without resorting to device-level mechanisms. Finally, we examine the trade-off between the sensors' coverage of the monitored space and the quality of the location estimates.

This paper focuses on achieving unambiguous user positioning using practical Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons with multiple discrete power levels. By receiving the beacon coverage status from a user's device, the cloud server can unambiguously pinpoint the user's location and react correspondingly. We first define the problem of beacon deployment for positioning (BDP) and provide several theoretic bounds on the number of required beacons to gain sufficient understanding on its performance behavior. The BDP problem is further formulated into an integer linear program (ILP) and solved in extensive case studies. We claim that this is the first systematic and in-depth research on beacon deployment for unambiguous user positioning. Our analysis and experiments show that the proposed solution takes O(root N) to O(N/2) beacons for N test positions, which is 2-8 times less beacons compared to that by the naive approach, while the analytical bounds are tight with the ILP results with 20% of gap.

Equipped with a four-coil inductive link, the EnerCage-HC2 system wirelessly powers the receiver (Rx) headstage, irrespective of the subject's location or head orientation, eliminating the need for tethering or carrying bulky batteries. On the transmitter (Tx) side, a driver coil, five high-quality (Q) factor segmented resonators at different heights and orientations, and a closed-loop Tx power controller create a homogeneous electromagnetic (EM) field within the homecage 3-D space, and compensate for drops in power transfer efficiency (PTE) due to Rx misalignments. The headstage is equipped with four small slanted resonators, each covering a range of head orientations with respect to the Tx resonators, which direct the EM field toward the load coil at the bottom of the headstage. Moreover, data links based on Wi-Fi, UART, and Bluetooth low energy are utilized to enables remote communication and control of the Rx. The PTE varies within 23.6%-33.3% and 6.7%-10.1% at headstage heights of 8 and 20 cm, respectively, while continuously delivering >40 mW to the Rx electronics even at 90 degrees rotation. As a proof of EnerCage-HC2 functionality in vivo, a previously documented on-demand electrical stimulation of the globus pallidus, eliciting consistent head rotation, is demonstrated in three freely behaving rats.

J	Petracca, M; Passaro, P; Gioia, E				Petracca, Matteo; Passaro, Pierluigi; Gioia, Egidio			AMBER: Advanced Mother Board for Embedded systems pRototyping	EURASIP JOURNAL ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Embedded system design; Fast prototyping; Industrial internet of things; IIoT gateway design		The proliferation of low-cost embedded system platforms has allowed the creation of large communities of developers, as well as the development of new advanced applications. Even though some of these applications can be of industrial relevance, their immediate application to real products is not straightforward since most of them require a complete and expensive hardware redesign of the considered embedded solution. To speed up the technological transfer of custom embedded solutions while overtaking the limits imposed by a complete hardware redesign, the article presents AMBER, an innovative embedded platform leveraging on a design based on System-on-Modules (SOM) and Extender modules. AMBER decouples the processing part of the system, which is fully contained on the SOM, from the peripherals, which are contained on the main board and Extender modules. This allows a smooth industrialoriented redesign of the embedded solution. In the article, AMBER is first presented starting from its philosophy and design choices while highlighting its main features. Then, an application of AMBER as an enhanced gateway to be used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario is reported by considering a monitoring and actuation use case. The IIoT-oriented AMBER solution is hardware and software configured to support real-time communications with actuators compliant with the Powerlink standard, as well as to interact with sensors compliant with Bluetooth Low Energy. Performance results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in the selected industrial scenario while promoting a fast and immediate transfer in new embedded products targeted to IIoT applications.

In a dense area, a leader root is elected during the leader election phase and a min-path algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal number of rings for various numbers of discoverable roots. According to the optimal configuration, the leader root connects to its one-hop neighboring roots to form the first-tier ring; each new root connects with one downstream root, and these roots connect together to form the second-tier ring until the desired outermost ring is reached. In sparse areas, each root constructs its own spanning tree subnet, finally creating a multi-ring tree scatternet. To achieve the least route discovery overhead, a multi-hop self-routing protocol is developed to efficiently deliver packets. Computer simulations show that the optimal multi-ring subnet can be determined; the optimal multi-ring tree outperforms conventional dual ring-tree (DRT) and Bluetooth hybrid ring-tree (BlueHRT) in terms of network performance.

J	Jeon, WS; Jeong, DG				Jeon, Wha Sook; Jeong, Dong Geun			Enhanced Channel Access for Connection State of Bluetooth Low Energy Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; connection state; data channel access scheme; Markov analysis	TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEM; IOT	According to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specifications, a pair of connected devices (master and slave) should sleep whenever packet transmission is failed twice consecutively, although they still have packets to be sent. However, when BLE devices are densely deployed in a small geographical area, such sleeping can occur frequently, and as a result, the BLE performance can be degraded largely. Moreover, when considering that a message consists of multiple packets in many Internet of things (IoT) applications, the situation gets worse because the master and slave of BLE alternately have the transmission opportunity not in the unit of message but in the unit of packet. In this paper, we suggest two enhancements of data channel access for improving the BLE performance by making up the above-mentioned weaknesses: One is to continue packet transmission by avoiding bad-quality channel via channel hopping instead of sleeping; the other is a message-based alternation of transmission opportunity between master and slave. We formulate a Markov model for analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme and derive a closed-form solution. The numerical results demonstrate that, from the proposed two enhancements, the throughput and delay performances of BLE are remarkably improved with a slight increase of consumed energy.

Recently, several works have analyzed the topic of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device discovery through analytical or simulation models limited to version 4.x. Non-connectable and non-scannable undirected advertising has been shown to be a reliable alternative for discovering a high number of devices in a relatively short time period. However, new features of Bluetooth 5.0 allow us to define a variant on the device discovery process, based on BLE scannable undirected advertising events, which results in higher discovering capacities and also lower power consumption. In order to characterize this new device discovery process, we experimentally model the real device behavior of BLE scannable undirected advertising events. Non-detection packet probability, discovery probability, and discovery latency for a varying number of devices and parameters are compared by simulations and experimental measurements. We demonstrate that our proposal outperforms previous works, diminishing the discovery time and increasing the potential user device density. A mathematical model is also developed in order to easily obtain a measure of the potential capacity in high density scenarios.

Recent security research notes a trend in which developers and vendors have opted out of implementing Bluetooth Low Energy link security in many devices, en-abling protocol attacks and attack frameworks. To help defend devices with no link se-curity, researchers recommend the use of Bluetooth Low Energy traffic sniffers to generate auditable communications logs. Unfortunately, current sniffers can only follow a single connection at a time, and some are ineffective at capturing long-lived connections due to synchronization problems. These limitations make current sniffers impractical for use in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents Bluetooth Low Energy Multi (BLE-Multi), a firmware enhancement to the open-source Ubertooth One that enables the sniffing of multiple simultaneous long-lived connections. To increase the capture effectiveness for long-lived connections, a novel synchronization mechanism is proposed that uses transmissions of empty packets to infer information about connection timing. Multi-connection sniffing is achieved by opportunis-tically switching between connections as they move from the active to inactive state, which is an inherent function in Bluetooth Low Energy to help conserve energy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BLE-Multi simultaneously captures multiple active connec-tions while outperforming Ubertooth One when it captures a single connection, paving the way for the development and implementation of automated defensive tools for Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless sensor networks.

Electromagnetic (EM) simulations are essential and inevitable for modern LC oscillator design. Although EM-simulators provide high accuracy, the EM-simulation time is very long when metal-oxide-metal (MoM) capacitors are present. The proposed frame-based EM-simulation can significantly reduce the EM-simulation time even in the presence of MoM capacitors without influencing the accuracy. To verify the proposed method, a DCO was fabricated using a 55-nm CMOS process. Measurements of the DCO are in good agreement with the frame-based post-layout simulation results. In addition, the DCO has good performances with a low power consumption of approximately 0.68 mW.

In this study, we have selected IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4 for performance comparison in terms of delay, service ratio, traffic loss, activity factor and battery lifetime in a home automation scenario. Also, a low overhead protocol stack suitable for IoT applications is considered. The analysis takes into account heterogeneous devices and different traffic loads. The results show advantages and disadvantages with respect to the different performance indicators with generally satisfactory behavior for the three technologies. Among them, BLE is recognized as the most suitable candidate technology for the home automation domain.

J	Rondon, R; Gidlund, M; Landernas, K				Rondon, Raul; Gidlund, Mikael; Landernas, Krister			Evaluating Bluetooth Low Energy Suitability for Time-Critical Industrial IoT Applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Real-time; Industrial IoT; IWSN	NETWORKS	In recent years, integration of wireless sensor networks in industrial environments has greatly increased. With this trend, new fields such as industrial IoT have arisen, which in turn have opened the doors to new possibilities that are shaping the future of industrial automation. In contrast to regular wireless networks, however, industrial applications of WSN are characterized for being time-critical systems with highly stringent requirements that challenge all available technologies. Because of its ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units, reduced production costs, robustness and high throughput, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a potential candidate for these settings. This article explores the potential of BLE of meeting the real-time demands found in the domain of industrial process automation and industrial IoT. In order to evaluate the suitability of the protocol for these scenarios, the effect of adaptations in the retransmission scheme on the reliability and timeliness performance are thoroughly studied. Three retransmission schemes are evaluated and simulation results proved that by optimally modifying the BLE retransmission model, a maximum delay below 46 ms and a packet loss rate in the order of can be obtained, enabling BLE to fulfill the requirements of even the most demanding cases within the considered range of applications.

The proposed dc-dc buck converter is capable of handling loads from 10 mu A to 20 mA with high efficiency by applying triple mode (retention mode, PFM mode, and PWM mode), gate split technique, and AZCD. Retention mode is proposed to extend wide load range at ultralight load. Gate split technique adjusts the conduction loss and switching loss. AZCD reduces the operation duty of the high-speed comparator and avoid reverse current below light load. In IoT applications, each node communicates with other nodes through a Bluetooth low energy transceiver, which consumes very low current and is highly sensitive to supply noise. Therefore, the proposed dc-dc buck converter adopts the SSCG technique to reduce electromagnetic interference by up to 18 dB. This chip is implemented using 0.13 mu m CMOS technology with an active area of 820 x 800 mu m(2). The maximum power efficiency of the proposed dc-dc buck converter is 92.4% at a switching frequency of 2.5 MHz when the load current range is 10 to 20 mA. The input voltage range and the regulated output voltage are 2.2-3.3 and 1.7 V, respectively. In addition, the proposed dc-dc buck converter achieves over 74.2% efficiency in retention mode when the load current range is from 10 to 500 mu A.

J	Zhou, M; Wang, B; Tian, ZS; Xie, LB				Zhou, Mu; Wang, Bin; Tian, Zengshan; Xie, Liangbo			Hardware and software design of BMW system for multi-floor localization	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Multi-floor positioning; Data fusion; Robust M estimation; BLE; MEMS	LOCATION; ALGORITHM; TRACKING	Although the Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) sensors are capable of providing short-term high positioning accuracy, every positioning result significantly depends on the historical ones, which inevitably leads to the long-term error accumulation. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is independent of the accumulative error, but the positioning accuracy is suffered by the irregular jump error resulted from the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) jitter. Considering the requirement of accurate, seamless, and consecutive positioning by the existing commercial systems, we propose a new integrated BLE and MEMS Wireless (BMW) system for multi-floor positioning. In concrete terms, first of all, the way of fingerprint database construction with the reduced workload is introduced. Second, the fingerprint database is denoised by the process of affinity propagation clustering, outlier detection, and RSSI filtering. Third, the robust M estimation-based extended Kalman filter is applied to estimate the two-dimensional coordinates of the target on each floor. Finally, the barometer data are used to calculate the height of the target. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed system can not only restrain the accumulative error caused by the MEMS sensors but also eliminate the irregular jump error from the BLE RSSI jitter. In an actual multi-floor environment, the proposed system is verified to be able to achieve the Root Mean Square (RMS) positioning error within 1 m.

It uses a high resolution 32-channel flexible ECoG electrodes array to collect electrical signals of brain activities and to stimulate the lesions. Electronic circuits are designed for signal acquisition, processing and transmission using Bluetooth Low Energy 4 (LTE4) for wireless communication with cell phone. In-vivo experiments on a rat show that the flexible ECoG system can accurately record electrical signals of brain activities and transmit them to cell phone with a maximal sampling rate of 30 ksampling/s per channel. It demonstrates that the epilepsy lesions can be detected, located and treated through the ECoG system. The wireless ECoG system has low energy consumption and high brain spatial resolution, thus has great prospects for future application.

A novel transceiver structure including power and audio amplifiers for Internet of Things applications	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Internet of Things (IOT); Class D Audio Amplifier (CDA); Power Amplifier (PA); Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Transceiver energy model; Cyber physical system	ENERGY-MODEL; WIRELESS	Both of the Circuit and System design aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) are emerging with computation and communication issues. In communication, it utilizes transceivers like wireless sensor network (WSN). In spite of the conventional WSN, a key component of IoT is its direct engagement with humans (animals). Therefore, communication is required in audio-visual ranges. This means an IoT device (IoTD) will be ported with audio amplifiers. This paper presents a novel IoT transceiver with a reconfigurable PA-CDA with time-domain and task-oriented multiplexing. The run-time reconfiguration of an area-power-efficient common part is utilized. The topology and scheduling issues of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard are well-suited to the proposed architecture. Time, energy, and protocol concerns are studied and appropriate models presented. The PA and CDA operate in the 2.4 GHz and audio-range frequencies, respectively. The battery life and power consumption are improved by about 40% and 20%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ghorbani, A. R.; Ghaznavi-Ghoushchi, M.

As such, various self-service technologies (SSTs) were introduced over the years by researchers with the aim to increase the avenues of checking-in guests. Self-check-in kiosk is an invention that allows guests to check-in themselves using bar codes that were sent to them in advance. Although bar codes are able to reduce guests' waiting time, it cannot be used to unlock hotel rooms. This makes mobile device a better medium for hotel check-in and access control system. Despite mobile device is very convenient and easy to operate, guests would have to own the specific type of mobile device such as near-field communication smartphone and its customized application before using the system. This makes the solution not user-friendly to guests. Therefore, a novel encrypted quick response scheme is presented to extend the existing SST to unify the process of check-in and room access control. The proposed scheme uses quick response codes and cryptography techniques to generate secure hotel keys that can be printed or stored inside a smartphone, thus, supporting a wide range of guests.

J	Sung, JW; Han, SJ				Sung, Jung-Woong; Han, Seung-Jae			Data bundling for energy efficient communication of wearable devices	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Wearable device; Data bundling; Adaptive algorithm; Energy efficiency; Bluetooth	CLOUD	The amount of data that wearable devices send and receive is rapidly increasing and exceeds the capacity of the energy efficient link technologies (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy). High capacity wireless link typically requires high connection setup cost, while wearable devices are intrinsically equipped with small battery. To deal with this dilemma, we propose to aggregate multiple data transmission requests into a single chunk and send the aggregated chunk at once to reduce the energy consumption for connection setup. Where this concept of 'data bundling' has been used for cloud storage services, we apply this concept to wearable devices. Data bundling extends the data delivery delay and therefore it is suitable to the applications that do not require strict real-time delivery. In this paper, we initially focus on reducing the energy consumption and then consider the tradeoff relationship between energy reduction and the penalty caused by the bundling delay. We design three bundling schemes and implement them in a commercial smartwatch which is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth Classic link. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is experimentally demonstrated and useful insights on the characteristics of bundling are discovered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Darroudi, SM; Gomez, C				Darroudi, Seyed Mahdi; Gomez, Carles			Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Networks: A Survey	SENSORS			English	Review						Bluetooth Low Energy; Bluetooth Smart; mesh networks; survey; Internet of Things; IoT; 6LoWPAN; 6Lo; Bluetooth Smart Mesh		Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has gained significant momentum. However, the original design of BLE focused on star topology networking, which limits network coverage range and precludes end-to-end path diversity. In contrast, other competing technologies overcome such constraints by supporting the mesh network topology. For these reasons, academia, industry, and standards development organizations have been designing solutions to enable BLE mesh networks. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a consolidated view on this emerging area. This paper comprehensively surveys state of the art BLE mesh networking. We first provide a taxonomy of BLE mesh network solutions. We then review the solutions, describing the variety of approaches that leverage existing BLE functionality to enable BLE mesh networks. We identify crucial aspects of BLE mesh network solutions and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we highlight currently open issues.

J	Pau, G; Collotta, M; Maniscalco, V				Pau, Giovanni; Collotta, Mario; Maniscalco, Vincenzo			Bluetooth 5 Energy Management through a Fuzzy-PSO Solution for Mobile Devices of Internet of Things	ENERGIES			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Bluetooth 5; communication mode; energy efficiency; fuzzy logic controller; particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Energy efficiency is a fundamental requirement for a wireless protocol to be suitable for use within the Internet of Things. New technologies are emerging aiming at an energy-efficient communication. Among them, Bluetooth Low Energy is an appealing solution. Recently, the specifications of Bluetooth 5 have been presented with the purpose to offer significant enhancements compared to the earlier versions of the protocol. Bluetooth 5 comes with new communication modes that differ in range, speed, and energy consumption. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution to cope with the selection of the communication mode, among those introduced with Bluetooth 5, that allows the best energy efficiency. This communication mode, used by mobile devices, is dynamically regulated by varying the transmission power, returned as the output of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to achieve the optimal parameters of the proposed FLC, i.e., optimizing the triangular membership functions, by varying their range, to reach the best results concerning the battery life of mobile devices. The proposed FLC is based on triangular membership functions because they represent a good trade-off between computation cost and efficiency. The paper presents a detailed description of the FLC design, a logical analysis of the PSO algorithm for the derivation of best performance conditions values, and experimental assessments, obtained through testbed scenarios.

High power density is achieved via a unique combination of lithographically-patterned stretchable electronic framework together with screen-printed, densely-packed three-dimensional carbon-nanotube-based bioanode and cathode array arranged in a stretchable "island-bridge" configuration. The E-BFC maintains its performance even under repeated strains of 50%, and is stable for two days. When applied directly to the skin of human subjects, the E-BFC generates similar to 1 mW during exercise. The E-BFC is able to power conventional electronic devices, such as a light emitting diode and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. This is the first example of powering a BLE radio by a wearable biofuel cell. Successful generation of high power density under practical conditions and powering of conventional energy-intense electronic devices represents a major step forward in the field of soft, stretchable, wearable energy harvesting devices.

The ADC is compiled from a SPICE netlist, a technology rule file, and an object definition file into a design rule check and layout versus schematic clean layout and schematic in 28-nm FDSOI. The compiled SAR ADC reduces the design time necessary to port to a new technology, and to demonstrate technology porting the same SAR ADC architecture is compiled in 28-nm FDSOI with Input/Output (IO) transistors. This paper also includes a comparator clock generation loop that uses the bottom plate of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter. The proposed compiled core transistor SAR ADC achieves the stateof-the-art Figure of Merit (FoM) of 2.7 fJ/conv.step at 2 MS/s, and 3.5 fJ/conv.step at 20 MS/s with an area of 0.00312 mm(2).

J	Chernyshev, M; Valli, C; Johnstone, M				Chernyshev, Maxim; Valli, Craig; Johnstone, Michael			Revisiting Urban War Nibbling: Mobile Passive Discovery of Classic Bluetooth Devices Using Ubertooth One	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Bluetooth; Ubertooth; passive discovery; surveillance; forensics		The ubiquitous nature of Bluetooth technology presents opportunities for intelligence gathering based on historical and real-time device presence data. This information can be of value to law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and industry. Despite the introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy standard that incorporates anonymity preservation mechanisms, the presence of devices that support Classic Bluetooth that uses unique and persistent device identifiers is expected to remain significant for a number of years. The common approach to finding discoverable Classic Bluetooth devices relies on a standard inquiry process that is not truly passive. Furthermore, this approach fails to detect devices that remain undiscoverable. Ubertooth One, a low-cost open source Bluetooth development platform, can assist with overcoming this limitation in a truly passive manner, making it an attractive digital forensic instrument. Using vehicle-based sensors and parallel multi-method device discovery, we conduct a practical evaluation of Ubertooth One for passive discovery and contrast its discovery rate to the standard method. Based on 83 comparative field experiments, we show that Ubertooth One can produce forensically sound observations while able to discover up to ten times as many devices. We also show that this method can identify repeat device presence, as we observe 2370 instances of repeat observations on different days in single and multiple location scenarios. We conclude that this passive technique can complement the standard method and has the potential be used as a viable alternative.

J	Park, J; Cho, YK				Park, JeeWoong; Cho, Yong K.			Development and Evaluation of a Probabilistic Local Search Algorithm for Complex Dynamic Indoor Construction Sites	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Indoor localization	SAFETY MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; TRACKING; TECHNOLOGY; PROJECTS	The nature of an indoor construction site is dynamic and complex. This characteristic becomes even more evident when a multitude of interactions among workers, equipment, and materials exists. To assist various operations of construction, which are dynamic and complex in nature, previous research explored sensing technologies to discover advanced approaches to supporting construction operations. In particular, many researchers have focused on investigating the tracking of construction resources over the past several years. Despite the previous research efforts in radio-signal-strength-indication (RSSI)-based tracking systems, signal interference such as signal degradations, occlusions, obstructions, and multipath effects created by a complex and dynamic construction environment has not been clearly discussed. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of issues associated with signal interference is limited. This research aims to reduce the gap in knowledge of the RSSI-based tracking system when it is used in a highly noisy environment like a dynamic, complex, and large indoor construction site. This paper presents the development of a new probabilistic local search (PLS) algorithm using Bluetooth low energy network technology. The PLS is assessed with respect to accuracy, reliability, and robustness. Two conventional positioning methods are subjected to the same tests as a benchmark for comparison. The results indicate that PLS outperforms the other conventional methods when the signal interference is high and performs comparably when the signal interference is minimal.

They facilitate connections between citizens and organizations that are of paramount importance for their long-term sustainability. As cities become more complex and their communities more dispersed, questions such as ' where can I find...' are increasingly pertinent. In this paper, we introduce NomaBlue, a new vision of spatial recognition in smart cities, the proposed system is based on an intelligent nomadic data collection and users ' collaboration using smart Bluetooth technology. We demonstrate using two case-studies that our approach is capable of proposing an efficient spatial recognition service while supporting a range of users ' constraints, our system is disconnected from the internet, it can operate in any indoor/outdoor area, it doesn't require pre-defined geographic databases and uses a new concept of nomadic data collection and sharing to speed-up the circulating information in smart cities.

Clock spurs that degrade RX sensitivities are canceled by applying the SCCG to digital circuits or ADCs. The SCCG is integrated into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) SoC fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. A measured clock spur reduction of 34 dB and an RX sensitivity recovery of 5 dB are achieved by the proposed SCCG. The power consumption and occupied area of the SCCG is only 18 mu W and 40 mu m x 120 mu m, respectively.

Among the many proposals, wireless indoor localization mechanisms based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) are being widely explored. Most studies have focused on the evaluation of the capabilities of different mobile device brands and wireless network technologies. Furthermore, different parameters and algorithms have been proposed as a means of improving the accuracy of wireless-based localization mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the tuning of the RSSI fingerprint to be used in the implementation of a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 (BLE4.0) Bluetooth localization mechanism. Following a holistic approach, we start by assessing the capabilities of two Bluetooth sensor/receiver devices. We then evaluate the relevance of the RSSI fingerprint reported by each BLE4.0 beacon operating at various transmission power levels using feature selection techniques. Based on our findings, we use two classification algorithms in order to improve the setting of the transmission power levels of each of the BLE4.0 beacons. Our main findings show that our proposal can greatly improve the localization accuracy by setting a custom transmission power level for each BLE4.0 beacon.

It uses Wi-Fi for rough positioning and BLE for fine positioning. It is designed for use in public transportation system stations and terminals where the conditions are "hostile" or unfavourable due to signal noise produced by the continuous movement of passengers and buses, data collection conducted in the constant presence thereof, multipath fading, non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions, the fact that part of the wireless communication infrastructure has already been deployed and positioned in a way that may not be optimal for positioning purposes, variable humidity conditions, etc. The ultimate goal is to provide a service that may be used to assist people with special needs. We present experimental results based on scene analysis; the main distance metric used was the Euclidean distance but the Mahalanobis distance was also used in one case. The algorithm employed to compare fingerprints was the weighted k-nearest neighbor one. ForWi-Fi, with only three visible access points, accuracy ranged from 3.94 to 4.82 m, and precision from 5.21 to 7.0 m 90% of the time. With respect to BLE, with a low beacon density (1 beacon per 45.7 m(2)), accuracy ranged from 1.47 to 2.15 m, and precision from 1.81 to 3.58 m 90% of the time. Taking into account the fact that this system is designed to work in real situations in a scenario with high environmental fluctuations, and comparing the results with others obtained in laboratory scenarios, our results are promising and demonstrate that the system would be able to position users with these reasonable values of accuracy and precision.

The majority of activity recognition frameworks, however, employ a network of specialised building sensors or a network of body-worn sensors. As this approach suffers with respect to practicality, we propose the use of commercial off-the-shelf devices. In this work, we design and evaluate an activity recognition system composed of a smart watch, which is enhanced with location information coming from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the performance of this approach for a variety of activities performed in an indoor laboratory environment, using four supervised machine learning algorithms. Our experimental results indicate that our location-enhanced activity recognition system is able to reach a classification accuracy ranging from 92% to 100%, while without location information classification accuracy it can drop to as low as 50% in some cases, depending on the window size chosen for data segmentation.

UTI is easily treatable using antibiotics if identified in early stage. However, without early identification and treatment, UTI can be a major source of serious complications in geriatric patients, in particular, those suffering from neurodegen-erative diseases. Also, for infants who have difficulty in describing their symptoms, UTI may lead to serious development of the disease making early identification of UTI crucial. In this paper, we present a diaper-embedded, wireless, self-powered, and autonomous UTI monitoring sensor module that allows an early detection of UTI with minimal effort. The sensor module consists of a paper-based colorimetric nitrite sensor, urine-activated batteries, a boost dc-dc converter, a low-power sensor interface utilizing pulse width modulation, and a Bluetooth low energy module for wireless transmission. Experimental results show a better detection of nitrite, a surrogate of UTI, than that of conventional dipstick testing. The proposed sensor module achieves a sensitivity of 1.35 ms/(mg/L) and a detection limit of 4 mg/L for nitrite.

This paper proposes the definition of a new concept of AT within the context of the ITS, Assistive Intelligent Transportation System (AITS), analyzing its intrinsic requirements and providing a set of examples. We demonstrate that AITS must localize users with disabilities and identify their specific type of impairment in order to provide an efficient response, and we propose a specific procedure to guarantee anonymity while identifying the type of disability. Moreover, this new type of AT is illustrated by means of a new assistive intelligent pedestrian crossing application that is capable of localizing pedestrians with disabilities, identifying the specific type of impairment and providing an adaptive response to enhance functional capabilities of impaired pedestrians while crossing. By combining stereo-based object detection with radio-frequency identification technology (RFID and Bluetooth Low Energy), a specific solution to the problem of user localization and anonymous disability identification is proposed. Our approach has been validated in a real crosswalk scenario and it may be extended to other types of AITS, depending on the localization accuracy requirements and the range of operation of the specific application.

J	Yang, J; Poellabauer, C; Mitra, P				Yang, Jian; Poellabauer, Christian; Mitra, Pramita			Using Bluetooth Low Energy for Dynamic Information-Sharing in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication	SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-ELECTRONIC AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article								Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an energy-efficient radio communication technology that is rapidly gaining popularity for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While BLE was not designed specifically with vehicular communications in mind, its simple and quick connection establishment mechanisms make BLE a potential inter-vehicle communication technology, either replacing or complementing other vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies (such as the yet to be deployed DSRC). In this paper we propose a framework for V2V communication using BLE and evaluate its performance under various configurations. BLE uses two major methods for data transmission: (1) undirected advertisements and scanning (unconnected mode) and (2) using the central and peripheral modes of the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) connection (connected mode). This paper investigates quantitative and qualitative advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and proposes a communication framework based on the central/peripheral mode, which uses a random role switching technique to ensure frequent communication opportunities between devices. Further, experiments on BLE-equipped Android devices are used to study the impacts of different framework parameters on communication performance, loss rates, and scalability. The paper further discusses other limitations, prospects, and potential applications of a BLE-based communication framework for VANETs.

A number of efforts have been exerted to achieve high positioning accuracy. However, there exists no technology that proves its efficacy in various situations. In this paper, we propose a novel positioning method based on fusing trilateration and dead reckoning. We employ Kalman filtering as a position fusion algorithm. Moreover, we adopt an Android device with Bluetooth Low Energy modules as the communication platform to avoid excessive energy consumption and to improve the stability of the received signal strength. To further improve the positioning accuracy, we take the environmental context information into account while generating the position fixes. Extensive experiments in a testbed are conducted to examine the performance of three approaches: trilateration, dead reckoning and the fusion method. Additionally, the influence of the knowledge of the environmental context is also examined. Finally, our proposed fusion method outperforms both trilateration and dead reckoning in terms of accuracy: experimental results show that the Kalman-based fusion, for our settings, achieves a positioning accuracy of less than one meter.

Home-based self-testing (HBST) for HIV holds promise for promoting regular testing among these individuals, but currently available HBSTs have limited follow-up options, providing only a 1-800 number that participants can call. Failure to actively conduct follow-up counseling and referrals after HBST use could result in delays in seeking confirmatory testing and care among users receiving reactive (preliminary positive) test results. HBST also fails to connect users who test negative with other prevention services that can reduce their future risk for HIV. Objective: The aim of our study was to use qualitative research methods with high-risk MSM to inform development of a "smart" HBST kit. The kit utilizes existing Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies to monitor HBST use in real-time and enable delivery of timely, active follow-up counseling and referrals over the phone. Methods: In phase 1, individual interviews (n=10) explored how participants might use HBST and their views and preferences for conducting counseling and referral after HBST. Based on these perspectives, we developed a smartphone app (iOS, Android) that uses data from light sensors on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons to monitor when HBST kits are opened, facilitating timely follow-up phone contact with users. In phase 2, a usability study conducted among high-risk MSM (n=10) examined the acceptability and feasibility of this system and provided user perspectives after using the system along with HBST. Results: Phase 1 themes suggested that MSM preferred HBST, that most thought active follow-up after HBST would be valuable, and that doing so over the phone within 24 h after testing was preferable. Phase 2 results showed that the eTEST system successfully detected HBST use in nearly all cases. Participant perspectives also suggested that the timing, method (ie, phone call), and duration of follow-up were appropriate and helpful. Conclusions: Using BLE beacons and a smartphone app to enable follow-up counseling and referral over the phone after HBST use is feasible and acceptable to high-risk MSM. Future research is needed to compare the effects of follow-up counseling on rates of repeat testing and receipt of referral services (eg, testing for sexually transmitted infections and initiation of preexposure prophylaxis) and to explore the acceptability of the eTEST system over longer periods of time.

It exploits fast switching speed and low internal capacitances of deep-nanoscale CMOS devices to realize a high intermediate-frequency (IF) architecture based on switched-capacitor-based charge-domain bandpass filtering. Power consumption is minimized by aggressively reducing the size of MOS devices and judiciously applying a samplingrate decimation. The resultant increase in the flicker noise is mitigated by placing the IF frequency beyond the flicker corner frequency. Likewise, the decimation-induced aliasing is mitigated by DT filtering of preceding stages. The BLE RX is fully standard-compliant and achieves a record-low-power consumption of 2.75 mW (including its local oscillator) while delivering the state-of-the-art performance: 6.5-dB noise figure and -19-dBm third-order input intercept point, with a direct antenna connection and thus without the typical external bandpass filters.

A snapshot time-to-digital converter (TDC) acts as a digital subsampler featuring an increased out-of-range gain and without any assistance from the traditional counting of DCO edges, thus further reducing power consumption. With a proposed DCO-divider phase rotation in the feedback path, the impact of the digital-to-time converter's (DTC's) non-linearity on the PLL is reduced and improves fractional spurs by at least 8 dB across BLE channels. Moreover, a "variable-preconditioned LMS" calibration algorithm is introduced to dynamically correct the DTC gain error with fractional frequency control word (FCW) down to 1/16384. Fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, the SS-DPLL achieves phase noise performance of -109 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, while consuming a record-low power of 1.19 mW.

This paper presents a generic received-signal-strength (RSS) threshold optimization framework for generating informative proximity reports. The proposed framework contains five main building blocks, namely the deployment information, RSS model, positioning metric selection, optimization process and management. Among others, we focus on Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based RSS models and positioning metric computation. The optimal RSS threshold is found through minimizing the best achievable localization root-mean-square-error formulated with the aid of fundamental lower bound analysis. Computational complexity is compared for different RSS models and different fundamental lower bounds. The resulting optimal RSS threshold enables enhanced performance of new fashioned low-cost and low-complex proximity report-based positioning algorithms. The proposed framework is validated with real measurements collected in an office area where bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) beacons are deployed.

J	Park, J; Chen, JD; Cho, YK				Park, JeeWoong; Chen, Jingdao; Cho, Yong K.			Self-corrective knowledge-based hybrid tracking system using BIM and multimodal sensors	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Building Information Model (BIM); Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Data fusion	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; INDOOR LOCALIZATION; CONSTRUCTION SITES; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; WIRELESS; OPERATIONS	Researchers have recently devoted considerable attention to acquiring location awareness of assets. They have explored various technologies, such as video cameras, radio signal strength indicator-based sensors, and motion sensors, in the development of tracking systems. However, each system presents unique drawbacks especially when applied in complex indoor construction environments; this paper classifies them into two categories: absolute tracking and relative tracking. By understanding the nature of problems in each tracking category, this research develops a novel tracking methodology that uses knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of various components used in the proposed tracking system. This paper presents the development of a hybrid-tracking system that integrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, motion sensors, and Building Information Model (BIM). The hypothesis tested through this integration was whether such knowledge-based integration could provide a method that can correct errors found in each of the used sensing technologies and thereby improve the reliability of the tracking system. Field experimental trials were conducted in a full-scale indoor construction site to assess the performance of individual components and the integrated system. The results indicated that the addition of map knowledge from a BIM model showed the capability of correcting improbable movements. Furthermore, the knowledge-based decision making process demonstrated its capability to make positive interaction by reducing the positioning errors by 42% on average. In sum, the proposed hybrid-tracking system presented a novel method to compensate for the weakness of each system component and thus achieve a more accurate and precise tracking in dynamic and complex indoor construction sites.

J	Xiang, LY; Tai, TY; Li, BC; Li, B				Xiang, Liyao; Tai, Tzu-Yin; Li, Baochun; Li, Bo			Tack: Learning Towards Contextual and Ephemeral Indoor Localization With Crowdsourcing	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Smart devices; bluetooth; crowdsourcing; indoor environments; localization; mobile computing; inference mechanisms; particle filters		At events, such as conferences, indoor localization is both contextual and ephemeral, in that localization is only needed within the context of and for the duration of the event. As such, the costs and requirements of providing such services need to be minimal. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Tack, a new mobile application framework that is specifically engineered to support such contextual and ephemeral indoor localization during an event. To provide location-based services with Tack, an event organizer only needs to bring and place a small number of (reusable) beacons around the venue before the event begins. As a system framework, Tack uses a combination of known beacon locations, contacts over bluetooth low energy, crowdsourcing, and dead-reckoning to estimate and refine user locations. To make our location estimates more accurate, we embrace the inherent nature of beacons, design crowdsourcing-based inference algorithms, and present an extensive evaluation by running real-world experiments with iOS devices and beacons. Tack has been implemented as an open-source framework on the iOS platform and can be used by mobile applications designed for events with location-based services.

BLE devices are designed to maximize the battery life, i. e., to run for long time on a single coin-cell battery. In typical application scenarios of home automation and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the sensors that monitor relatively unpredictable and rare events should coexist with other sensors that continuously communicate health or environmental parameter measurements. The former usually work in connectionless mode, acting as advertisers, while the latter need a persistent connection, acting as slave nodes. The coexistence of connectionless and connection-oriented networks, that share the same central node, can be required to reduce the number of handling devices, thus keeping the network complexity low and limiting the packet's traffic congestion. In this paper, the medium access management, operated by the central node, has been modeled, focusing on the scheduling procedure in both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. The models have been merged to provide a tool supporting the configuration design of BLE devices, during the network design phase that precedes the real implementation. The results highlight the suitability of the proposed tool: the ability to set the device parameters to allow us to keep a practical discovery latency for event-driven sensors and avoid undesired overlaps between scheduled scanning and connection phases due to bad management performed by the central node.

Due to the widespread availability of IEEE 802.11, many localization platforms have been proposed, based on the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) indicator, using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method that combines the simplicity (and low cost) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the popular 802.11 infrastructure, to improve the accuracy of indoor localization platforms. Building on KNN, we propose a new positioning algorithm (dubbed i-KNN) which is able to filter the initial fingerprint dataset (i. e., the radiomap), after considering the proximity of RSS fingerprints with respect to the BLE devices. In this way, i-KNN provides an optimised small subset of possible user locations, based on which it finally estimates the user position. The proposed methodology achieves fast positioning estimation due to the utilization of a fragment of the initial fingerprint dataset, while at the same time improves positioning accuracy by minimizing any calculation errors.

In order to decrease the die area, only two inductors were used in this work. Besides the one used in the voltage control oscillator (VCO), the PA load inductor was reused as the RX impedance matching component in the front-end. Proper controls have been applied to achieve high transmitter (TX) input impedance when the transceiver is in the receiving mode, and vice versa. This allows the TRX-switch/matching network integration without significant performance degradation. The RX adopted a low-IF structure and integrated a single-ended low noise amplifier (LNA), a current bleeding mixer, a 4th complex filter and a delta-sigma continuous time (CT) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The TX employed a two-point PLL-based architecture with a non-linear PA. The RX achieved a sensitivity of 93 dBm and consumes 9.7 mW, while the TX achieved a 2.97% error vector magnitude (EVM) with 9.4 mW at 0 dBm output power. This design was fabricated in a 0.11 mu m complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and the front-end circuit only occupies 0.24 mm(2). The measurement results verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed BLE transceiver for WSN applications.

It features a double-balanced mixer topology combining nMOS current-bleeding transistors with a pMOS local oscillator switching quad, and forward-body bias and inductive-gate bias techniques to secure an adequate performance at a supply voltage down to 0.35 V. Fabricated in 0.13-mu m CMOS, the prototype exhibits a conversion gain of 13.77 dB, a third-order intercept point of -3.5 dBm, and a noise figure of 18 dB. The power consumption is 520 mu W, and port-to-port isolation is > 55 dB. The achieved figure of merit compares favorably with the state of the art.

A 35-mu A photoplethysmography (PPG) signal chain that consumes five times lower power than state of the art has been demonstrated. An SNR of > 80 dBFS was achieved using circuit and system techniques that enable sub-1% analog duty cycling. Input signal-aware, on-the-fly, real-time data path adaptation algorithms implemented on an external microcontroller and synchronized by an ultralow power on-chip FSM along with a 1.3-mu W, 14-b, 1-kSPS SAR ADC further lower system energy. A programmable, asynchronous reset capacitive amplifier (PARCA) with noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 4.8 and dx/dt analog feature extractor demonstrates energy efficient electrocardiogram (ECG) capture. A wearable platform using this SoC that simultaneously captures ECG plus PPG and wirelessly transmits the heart rate using Bluetooth low energy every 2 s to a smartphone lasts for greater than five days from a 250-mAhr battery.

A transmitter (TX) employs an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with a switched current-source digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) featuring low frequency pushing, and class-E/F-2 digital power amplifier (PA), featuring high efficiency. Low 1/f DCO noise allows the ADPLL to shut down after acquiring lock. The receiver operates in discrete time at high sampling rate (similar to 10 Gsamples/s) with intermediate frequency placed beyond 1/f noise corner of MOS devices. New multistage multirate charge-sharing bandpass filters are adapted to achieve high out-of-band linearity, low noise, and low power consumption. An integrated on-chip matching network serves to both PA and low-noise transconductance amplifier, thus allowing a 1-pin direct antenna connection with no external band-selection filters. The TRX consumes 2.75 mW on the RX side and 3.7 mW on the TX side when delivering 0 dBm in BLE.

To reduce cellular tail energy use, existing solutions either require changing application behavior or assume the availability of low-level control of cellular interface (e.g., fast dormancy). We propose a collaborative cellular tail energy reduction approach for background traffic, which opportunistically discovers neighbors using low-power Bluetooth radio and shares their cellular bandwidth. Furthermore, we define a rigorous fairness notion by adapting the generalized processor sharing concept. Our sharing scheduling algorithm uses this notion to achieve substantial energy saving while ensuring fairness for participating phones and is also robust to whitewash attacks. Our evaluation demonstrates up to 90% saving for background traffic energy consumption in urban settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pipino, A; De Matteis, M; Wan, KR; Baschirotto, A				Pipino, Alessandra; De Matteis, Marcello; Wan, Karen; Baschirotto, Andrea			A Simple Algorithm for Specs Definition in Wireless Receivers	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						RF front-end; analog baseband; link budget; RX architecture; Bluetooth low energy	CMOS TRANSCEIVER; BLUETOOTH	This paper presents a system-level design procedure for wireless receivers, which allows an optimum distribution of the specifications-per-stage along the receiver. The main idea hereby developed is to start from a specific set of requirements (given by the selected telecommunications standards) in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) and blocker mask scenario in frequency domain, and to finally achieve a certain set of specifications for each stage in the receiver chain (i.e., LNA, mixer, baseband and ADC). The proposed system-level design algorithm allowsfixing the receiver specifications-per-stage with a reduced set of equations and successive iterations. Moreover, an optimum design for baseband section (i.e., complex-filter and the ADC) is also found, by achieving an optimum trade-or between-filter order and ADC equivalent-number-of-bits (ENOB). In order to validate the hereby proposed algorithm, a low-energy Bluetooth low-IF receiver has been modeled and simulated (by Simulink), and extensive time-domain simulation results have been provided, complying with the expected Bluetooth standard signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR).

Platform for the management of hydraulic chambers based on mobile devices and Bluetooth Low-Energy motes	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Telemetry; Bluetooth low-Energy; Geo-localization; Collective water distribution networks; Water and energy management	IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS; PRECISION AGRICULTURE; SYSTEMS; INFRASTRUCTURE; CHALLENGES; SUPPORT; SPAIN	Agencies and institutions that are in charge of water distribution and treatment facilities devote significant resources to inspection and control of such facilities. In this paper, the procedures involved in these activities are discussed and optimized for automated treatment with mobile devices. To this purpose, a novel remote control application for the management and detection of faults and breakdowns of collective water distribution networks in irrigation systems has been developed. The developed platform makes use of BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) technology to provide contactless, context-and-positioning sensitive information to the user, simplifying periodic inspections and repairing tasks of the network infrastructure. Devices would be equipped with BLE-enabled motes capable of transmitting a beacon signal for equipment discovering. Operators in turn, would carry tablets or smartphones configured to detect the motes and stablish a link in case additional data must be exchanged. The tablet also allows the operator to revise and fill in a device's form customized with context sensitive information gathered from both the mote and the enterprise cloud services and finally, to update the information in the online databases.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Raza, S; Misra, P; He, ZT; Voigt, T				Raza, Shahid; Misra, Prasant; He, Zhitao; Voigt, Thiemo			Building the Internet of Things with bluetooth smart	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of things; IoT; Bluetooth LE; BLE; Open hardware; Open source; Contiki O.S		The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The applications of BLE are growing rapidly and there are many issues to be resolved for establishing the deployment of it. Practically, BLE devices may experience a lot of collisions during discovery process due to contention among devices, particularly in a crowded environment. With an increasing number of BLE devices, discovery latency and energy consumption rise exponentially, which could degrade the quality of service required by user applications. In this study, the authors propose an enhanced discovery mechanism by employing a backoff strategy for BLE devices to reduce collisions during advertisement process. Through experimental and mathematical analysis, the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in terms of discovery latency and energy consumption in crowded BLE networks.

The BLE standard specifies a wide range of configurable parameter values that determine the discovery process and need to be set according to the particular application requirements. Many previous works have been addressed to investigate the discovery process through analytical and simulation models, according to the ideal specification of the standard. However, measurements show that additional scanning gaps appear in the scanning process, which reduce the discovery capabilities. These gaps have been identified in all of the analyzed devices and respond to both regular patterns and variable events associated with the decoding process. We have demonstrated that these non-idealities, which are not taken into account in other studies, have a severe impact on the discovery process performance. Extensive performance evaluation for a varying number of devices and feasible parameter combinations has been done by comparing simulations and experimental measurements. This work also includes a simple mathematical model that closely matches both the standard implementation and the different chipset peculiarities for any possible parameter value specified in the standard and for any number of simultaneous advertising devices under scanner coverage.

Recognizing individuals in groups in outdoor environments combining stereo vision, RFID and BLE	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Individuals identification; Stereo; RFID; BLE; Data association; Sensor fusion; Outdoors		Vision-based people localization systems in outdoor environments can be enhanced by means of radio frequency identification technologies. This combination has the potential to enable a wide range of new applications. When individuals wear a radio frequency tag, they may be both identified and localized. In thisway, the technology may interact with individuals in a personalized way. In this paper, two radio frequency identification technologies, UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), are combined with a stereo-based people detection system to recognize individuals in groups in complex outdoor scenarios in medium sized areas up to 20 m. The proposed approach is validated in crosswalks with pedestrians wearing portable RFID passive tags and active BLE beacons.	[Llorca, D. F.; Quintero, R.; Parra, I.; Sotelo, M.

This method is based on recorded accelerations, and mechanical and transduction models that enable an efficient joint optimization of the structural parameters. An optimized prototype of 14.8 mmO x. 52 mm, weighting 20 g, has generated up to 4.95mW in a resistive load when worn at the arm during a run, and 6.57mW when hand-shaken. Among the inertial electromagnetic energy harvesters reported so far, this one exhibits one of the highest power densities (up to 730 mu W cm(-3)). The energy harvester was finally used to power a bluetooth low energy wireless sensor node with accelerations measurements at 25 Hz.

Monitoring and separating the activities of a specific individual in a multi-residential home is still, however, a significant challenge for these smart home applications. This paper proposes a new human identification sensor, which can efficiently differentiate multiple residents in a home environment to detect their height as a unique bio-feature. This sensor includes three sensing/communication modules: pyroelectric infrared (PIR) occupancy, ultrasound array, and bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication modules. The PIR occupancy module is used to detect the moving direction, while the ultrasound array module detects the moving residents' height. The combination of these two sensing technologies can be used to then detect the moving velocity. The BLE advertising mode is then used to communicate these data to the data server. A new embedded algorithm increased the energy efficiency of this identification technology. A comprehensive modeling and experiments are done to assess the performance of this sensor and the results are provided.

Due to the influence of various external environmental factors, it is very difficult to improve the accuracy in indoor location tracking. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel method of reducing the noise generated in the external environment by using a double Gaussian filter. In addition, the value of the RSSI signal generated in the BLE beacon is different for each device. In this study, we propose a method to allocate additional weights in order to compensate the intensity of signal generated in each device. This makes it possible to improve the accuracy of indoor location tracking using beacons. The experiment results show that the proposed method effectively decrease the RSSI deviation and increase location accuracy. In order to verify the usefulness of this study, we compared the Kalman filter algorithm which is widely used in signal processing. We further performed additional experiments for application area for indoor location service and find that the proposed scheme is useful for BLE-based indoor location service.

Two architectures, namely, with and without the microprocessor (MPU) and hinted handoff mechanism algorithm, are used to verify the data transmission loss between the BLE and the smart phone. The system not only employed low-power solution but also added full handshake and hinted handoff to achieve complete synchronization and accurate transmission reliability.

Bluetooth Low Energy, a Standard for This Evolution	SENSORS			English	Article						bluetooth low energy; mesh topology; Industry 4.0; Collaborative Mesh; Internet of Things (IoT); sensor network		Current sensor networks need to be improved and updated to satisfy new essential requirements of the Internet of Things, where cutting-edge applications will appear. These requirements are: total coverage, zero fails (high performance), scalability and sustainability (hardware and software). We are going to evaluate Bluetooth Low Energy as wireless transmission technology and as the ideal candidate for these improvements, due to its low power consumption, its low cost radio chips and its ability to communicate with users directly, using their smartphones or smartbands. However, this technology is relatively recent, and standard network topologies are not able to fulfil its new requirements. To address these shortcomings, the implementation of other more flexible topologies (as the mesh topology) will be very interesting. After studying it in depth, we have identified certain weaknesses, for example, specific devices are needed to provide network scalability, and the need to choose between high performance or sustainability. In this paper, after presenting the studies carried out on these new technologies, we propose a new packet format and a new BLE mesh topology, with two different configurations: Individual Mesh and Collaborative Mesh. Our results show how this topology improves the scalability, sustainability, coverage and performance.

It consists of a mobile application which uses either Bluetooth Low Energy technology or Quick Response codes to identify the stops. It is based on the location of the user to show the nearest stops and search the available bus routes. The application shows relevant information of each route and, using a digital map, draws its path and the stops it performs. In addition to this, it offers the "How do I get there" functionality that allows the user to search the available bus routes to move from one point to another within the city. In order to comply with this process, QBus performs a search of the bus routes that have stops near the points of origin and destination; this functionality indicates to the user the stop in which he must take the bus and in which it must get off. On the other hand the system consists of a web portal which allows to manage all the information of the application, ie cooperatives, stops and bus routes in a graphical way through the use of the Google Maps V3 API.

Framework of Automated Construction-Safety Monitoring Using Cloud-Enabled BIM and BLE Mobile Tracking Sensors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Building information model (BIM); Construction safety; Cloud computing; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Safety monitoring; Information technologies	HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; SITES; PROJECTS	Construction sites need to be monitored continuously to detect unsafe conditions and protect workers from potential injuries and fatal accidents. In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and errorprone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) realtime detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards. The results indicate that the proposed approach can assist in the construction site monitoring process and potentially improve site safety. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This goal can be achieved by adopting a suitable real-time communication protocol. In addition, connecting such systems with mobile devices is also desirable for performing configuration, monitoring, and maintenance activities. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) protocol would be an attractive solution for this purpose, because it is supported by consumer devices, such as tablets and smart phones, for implementing personal area networks with reduced energy consumption. Unfortunately, however, it cannot guarantee a bounded delay for managing real-time traffic. Modern BLE radio transceivers allow partitioning the network bandwidth between the BLE protocol and another user-defined protocol running on top of the raw radio. This paper exploits this feature to provide an analysis and a design methodology to guarantee the feasibility of a real-time custom protocol that shares the radio with the BLE. Experimental results on a Nordic reference platform show the feasibility of the dual-protocol approach and its capability to support a custom real-time protocol on the raw radio with a bounded overhead.

CRC Error Correction in IoT Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; cyclic redundancy check (CRC); error correction; IEEE 802.15.4; short-range internet-of-things (IoT)	CODES	In this paper, error correction is introduced to the Bluetooth low energy and IEEE 802.15.4 standards by utilizing data redundancy provided by cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes used by both protocols to detect erroneous packets. A scenario with an energy-constrained transmitter and a constraint-free infrastructure is assumed that enables additional signal processing at the receiving side, keeping the transmitter intact. CRC error correction is achieved using a novel approach of applying iterative decoding techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated based both on simulated and real packets. It is shown that by enabling CRC error correction, up to 2.5 dB of the signal to noise ratio gain can be achieved, while up to 35% of real corrupted packets can be corrected, at no extra cost for the transmitter. This results in potential range extension and longer battery life caused by a reduced number of retransmissions.

The parameter values used during neighbor discovery directly affect the performance of the NDP. Therefore, an optimal parameter setting is essential to achieve the best tradeoff between discovery latency and energy consumption. An analytical model can offer a beneficial guideline for such a parameter selection. In this paper, we propose a general model for analyzing the performance of NDP in BLE networks. In the model, the operations of the scanner and the advertiser, which are two main components of NDP, are expressed on the discrete-time axis. Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), the discovery latency and energy consumption of advertiser are derived. The numerical results from our model are almost the same as the simulation results, for any parameter values specified by the standard. When considering that BLE is one of candidate communication technologies for IoT, the proposed model is expected to be very useful in setting the default or initial values of NDP parameters for various IoT applications.

This antenna offers dual band operation. The prototype follows a configuration constituting a driven element (radiator) and a parasitic element. The first band offers a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) bandwidth (3:1) of 183 MHz (0.85-1.04 GHz). The VSWR bandwidth (3:1) for the second band is 2.77 GHz (2-4.77 GHz). It also offers a 3 dB AR bandwidth of 1.1 GHz (2.1-3.2 GHz). The 2:1 VSWR bandwidth of 0.9 GHz (2.1-3 GHz) and cross-polarisation in the second band makes this antenna suitable for 2.4 GHz RFID reader applications. The other services supported by the proposed antenna include global system for mobile communication (0.88-0.96 GHz), long-term evolution (2.3-2.4 GHz), wireless fidelity (2.4-2.5 GHz), bluetooth low energy (2.4 GHz) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (3.5 GHz). To extract the multiservice characteristics, it is necessary to integrate this antenna to a handheld computing platform. For assessing the performance in such a platform, the prototype is optimised and merged with a larger ground plane of size 170 mm x 130 mm and studied in the course of this study.

Many systems of which, propose the use of Received Signal Strength Indicator based location methods. The unpredictable propagation of these signals, in combination with surrounding signal noise and variable environmental conditions, makes it difficult to implement such systems as a simple entity. With the multitude of beacons on the market, it may be difficult to develop an optimal indoor positioning system for the desired application. To help address this issue, this paper compares three popular beacons, presents a simple mobile application based Kalman filter, and explores the correlation between transmit power and desired Kalman filter parameters.

In this paper, we focus on how to specify and verify where and how the data are received. The challenging issue here is how to utilize trustworthy 3rd party verification mechanisms to check whether a requester is in the designated area specified by the creator and whether the delivery follows a desired path. We call this new service Right Place, Right Path Data Delivery (R2D2). The current network and geolocation techniques are investigated for their capabilities in verifying and ensuring such R2D2 services. We created software tools to specify and verify such R2D2 services. We show that the verification of R2D2 services is quite challenging.	[Ashary, Ehab; Chow, C.

Low power design and self-sustainability are the key for the usability of our helmet, to avoid frequent battery recharges and dangerous power losses. Hidden in the helmet structure, the designed system is equipped with a dense sensor network including accelerometer, temperature, light, and alcohol gas level, in addition, a Bluetooth low energy module interfaces the device with an onvehicle IR camera, and eventually the user's smart phone. To keep the driver focused, the user interface consists of a small non-invasive display combined with a speech recognition system. System architecture is optimized for aggressive power management, featuring an ultra-low power wake-up radio, and fine-grained software-controlled shutdown of all sensing, communication and computing subsystems. Finally, a multi-source energy harvesting module (solar and kinetic) performs high-efficiency power recovery, improving battery management and achieving self-sustainability. SHelmet supports rich context awareness applications; breath alcohol control; real time vehicle data; sleep and fall detection; data display. Experimental results show that is possible achieve self-sustainability and demonstrate functionality of the developed node.

We analyze two positioning techniques, fingerprinting and particle filtering, for two usage scenarios. The first scenario refers to a corridor with beacons placed along a straight line at equal distances one from another. The second scenario refers to a generic room divided in imaginary cells with beacons placed in the corners and the center of the room. For the first scenario, the best results were obtained using particle filtering which provided an accuracy of less than 2 meters. For the second scenario, fingerprinting provided the best accuracy with an error of about 2 meters. The results suggest that the particularities of a room may provide different outcomes, thus the characteristics of the room should be clearly defined.

This approach is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to control the parking process without having to investment in sensors. Parking violations can be easily detected through the proposed collaborative process among user's mobile devices. A reward mechanism incentives users' participation. This approach uses an ad hoc network of users who send information to a central system regarding georeferenced beacon information. Comparing with previous payments associated with a vehicle, the approach can identify parking violations, e.g. parking without associated payment.

This creates a huge demand of long-term health care. In many long-term care institutes, a caregiver has to take care of many elderly people at the same time. Some of them have been paralyzed in bed, while others are still able to move in the institutes. It is not uncommon that a caregiver has to spend a lot of time to find an elder to perform daily care operations, such as injections, medications, and blood pressure measuring. Elders may move in dangerous places, such as kitchens, stairs, and bathrooms. In this paper, we present an iBeacon-based indoor positioning system for long-term care institutes. Thus, the staffs of long-term care institutes can easily locate the elders, and be notified when some elders move in dangerous places.

We exploit multiple wireless sniffers to pervasively collect human mobility data from people with mobile devices and identify similarities and the group mobility based on the wireless fingerprints. We propose a method which initially converts the wireless packets collected by the sniffers into people's wireless fingerprints. The method then determines group mobility by finding the statuses of people at certain times (dynamic/static) and the space correlation of dynamic people. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct real world experiments by collecting data from 10 participants carrying Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons in an office environment for a two-week period. The proposed approach captures space correlation with 95% and group mobility with 79% accuracies on average. With the proposed approach we successfully 1) detect the groups and individual movements and 2) generate social networks based on the group mobility characteristics.

Continuous monitoring is performed by means of massive machinery, requiring complex installation at the patient's premises, or cumbersome portable devices. Combining noninvasive wearable monitoring devices, based on patient's criticality, it is possible to obtain qualitative data to evaluate the patient's quality of life variation. In clinical environment it is possible to talk of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). It can be defined as the physical, mental and social outcome of medical treatment and chronic disease. These effects can be measured not only through the patient's perception but also with objective evaluations on patient's physical status. Aim of this paper is to introduce a simple and pervasive methodology to monitor the QoL variation by means of two portable devices already available on the market: a Bluetooth Low Energy Activity Tracker (BLE-ACT) and a Bluetooth Loop and Event Recorder (BT-LER). Using objective qualitative measurements obtained via such devices that follow the Pervasive Computing Paradigm (Ubicomp), it is possible to Estimate the QoL variation.

This paper has a twofold goal, to propose an IoT architecture linking physical devices with operators to afford efficient communication (green-BY concept) and to provide energy-saving oriented techniques to encourage the deployment of cost-effective networks, which enhances the lifespan of IoT devices (green-IN concept). Namely, we propose a flexible sleep-based algorithm called SustainaBLE, suitable for a wide range of domains using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A real case studio has been carried out to provide power consumption measurements using SustainaBLE proposal, achieving one-year autonomy compared to one-day autonomy with BLE Connection mode. This achievement en courages us to broaden our experimental study considering more nodes, different topologies and additional standards for contributing to the future Industrial IoT networks.

A trace obtained from an actual user movement is considered as being more realistic than using synthetic mobility models in simulators. Though realistic, usually, these traces lack information about the actual wireless contact durations between users. Most simulators use Unit Disk Graph (UDG) model to determine contact durations. However, due to the nature of radio propagations, a simplistic connectivity model (with UDG) may result in simulating unrealistic connectivity patterns. In this work, we have used an Android Smartphone application to collect GPS traces of moving users and their corresponding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) contact times to compare the viability of using UDG to determine contact durations. The results show that trace based model with UDG based wireless connectivity is an effective method to determine contact durations.

Technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and RFID are commonly used to provide connectivity to people living in such spaces. However, these technologies can also be exploited to automatically detect empty/occupied indoor areas and who is occupying that area. Our work goes toward such direction proposing an occupancy detection strategy based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack. We designed our solution by considering two fundamental challenges: costs and power-efficiency. We tested our system in several offices of our research institute by deploying few Bluetooth receivers and assigning to people a Bluetooth tag integrated with the institute's badge. We analyzed the performance of our solution with Bluetooth tags emitting at one single power first, and then we further refined our solution by considering the possibility of using beacons emitting simultaneously at different powers. The obtained results show a high accuracy without significantly affecting the energy consumption of the tags.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models. We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models. Also, the proximity classification accuracy increased by up to 103% and 70% in parametric and machine learning models, respectively. This work is one of the first studies (if not the first) that analyze in depth the TX power variations in improving the distance estimation and classification.

With the rapid development of digital technologies and competitiveness between companies in the same industry or with alternative industries, businesses tend to excite their customers to obtain the competitive advantage. Conversely, with the understanding of the competitiveness of businesses, customers change their expectation and demand for a better service and engagement. As a result, digital technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon technology overruled the existing methods of customer engagement. Though there are a lot of businesses which have adapted beacon technology to enhance customer engagement, there is lack of evidence of its adaptation in the insurance sector. Therefore, this paper aims to use beacon technology to enhance the customer engagement in insurance companies.	[Wanniarachchi, Vajisha U.; Fernando, O. N.

A higher order provides more attenuation for them but proportionally increases the power consumption and chip area. We present the procedure to determine the orders of a multistage CIC filter by using the analytical expressions of its output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rejection in the signal band. The derived expressions first show a lower limit for the order to achieve the required SNR and then provide orders to satisfy the rejection requirements. A two-stage CIC filter consisting of 2nd- and 3rd-order CIC filters with a total decimation factor of 1024 is designed for a direct-RF sampling receiver complying with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in MATLAB/ Simulink. Simulations show that the CIC filter completely removes the folded quantization noise of a 2nd-order bandpass delta-sigma modulator and has a rejection of 63 dB for out-of-band blockers. The proposed procedure provides the lowest order of each CIC filter to enable the receiver to satisfy the SNR and out-of-band blocking requirements of BLE.

Our system uses BLE-based ID logs to analyze daily social behaviors, such as how a child spent the day with his/her friends. Furthermore, we also use accelerometer logs to detect the period when the user (i.e., a child) was with friends or not, and what kind of activity (e.g., walking or staying in one place) the user was involved in. We conducted a five-day experiment with four families using our system. We also interviewed the families' parents and compared their responses with the analyzed results to investigate the accuracy of the above detection and usability of our system. The result shows that our system can detect the period when the child was with other friends or alone, as well as the activity (s) he was involved in.

Experimentation demonstrates that the RSSI value of BLE signals is unstable in indoor environments. The principle underlying this behavior is discussed in this paper. Two self-adaptive filters (smoothing filter and wavelet filter) are applied to stabilize and de-noise the RSSI sequence. We demonstrate that the stability of localization performance is enhanced by employing these filters. The standard deviation of the RSSI sequence is reduced from 4.6 meters to 0.8 meters, which means that a steady increase in the accuracy and stabilization of the localization is achieved.

The MCL was upgraded from Markov localization, with both belonging to the family of probabilistic approaches. Throughout the last decade, laser rangefinders and gyroscopes have been applied to MCL-based robotic localization systems with remarkable success. However, the utilization of MCL-based indoor localization for mobile devices, by applying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors, is still being researched. In this paper, we present a technique that utilizes MCL that exploits two sensors, namely, the accelerometer and compass, with commonly deployed BLE beacons to localize people with mobile devices indoors. Experimental results illustrate that, by applying MCL with BLE beacons using an accelerometer and compass, the error of the calculated coordinates for the user position is less than 1 m in line of-sight (LOS) environments, while in a complex non-LOS environment, the average error is 3 m. Meanwhile, the proposed MCL system does not demand a high deployment density of BLE beacons compared with triangulation and trilateration-based indoor positioning algorithms.

Novel seamless navigation system design was implemented and tested to achieve this aim. The design consists of general navigation system framework blocks and of the necessary interface agreements between the blocks. This approach enables plug-and-play style design of modules. The implementation used four preselected key technologies. Microstrain 3DM-GX4-45 foot-mounted inertial measurement unit sensor data was fused together with the u-blox GNSS receiver positions outdoors. Context sensitive inference engine enabled the fusion of position updates indoors from the Decawave TREK1000 Ultra WideBand ranging kit and from the 6 Kontakt.io/Raspberry Pi anchor-based Bluetooth low energy fingeprinting system. Novel dual-mode filter design uses a particle filter and the pentagon buffer enhanced Kalman filter in the position solution derivation. Depending on the map and the walls in the environment and on the quality of position updates, the implemented control logic employs the most fit filter for the current context. Computational power is now focussed, when particle filter is needed. The novel pentagon buffer enhanced Kalman filter is 10 times faster, allowing power saving when situation is not too critical. Moreover, the buffer provides position updates by interacting with the map and helps to correct the position solution. The navigation system is seamless according to the tests conducted around and within the Nottingham Geospatial building. No user input is needed for smooth transition from outdoors to indoors and vice versa. The system achieves an accuracy of 2.35 m outdoors and 1.4 m indoors (95% of error). Inertial system availability was continuous, while GNSS was available outdoors and BLE and UWB indoors.

The preferred method of tethering these devices to the Internet is through the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication protocol connecting them to special-purpose mobile applications. The efficient development of high-quality applications of this type can present challenges to developers who have to familiarize themselves with a number of new technologies and platform-specific architectural patterns. A combination of domain-specific languages and code-generation techniques is a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we present (a) a generic reference architecture for Android BLE-enables applications, and (b) our AHL (Android Health Language), a domain-specific language and a corresponding co-degeneration framework that enables the easy and rapid development of the core elements of a typical BLE-enabled data-collection application in this architecture. The generated code is functional and does not need any modifications. This model-driven application-construction process relieves developers from the burden of dealing with complex Android concepts and components. Thus, AHL can save time and reduce the cost of Android application development for developers. In this paper, we explain the AHL framework, its models, its underlying DSL, and the methodology we used to design and implement it. We evaluate our work with two functional applications and compare them to the existing ones developed from scratch.

However, the Wi-Fi access nodes (WFAN) are fixed and cannot provide the same signal strength to every covered region. The signal strength for some regions are poor. Hence, it is difficult to solve the poor signal strengths in some regions. This paper proposes a manager device that can utilize both positions of the indoor positioning monitor device and the WFAN in our experiment environment. We use BLE beacons to achieve our indoor positioning and implement a movable device to carry the WFAN. On basis of the results, our system can judge current WFAN's position and move to appropriate positon in the indoor environment. In our experiments, the calculated position and actual position of our manager device have average differences of 0.807 m, respectively. Our manager device can order the WFAN to move to appropriate position that is based on the positions of the other environment devices and provide better wireless access quality.

This model is using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as the RF signal for indoor localization service. The fingerprinting approach, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is used to cut-down the cost of implementation and the accuracy can be further improved with more BLE beacons installed The RSSI technique applied will be further improved with signal selecting algorithm to determine the right reference points for positioning service. An error compensation algorithm also will be applied to eliminate the false signal which will affect the system's accuracy. This proposed model includes implementation of enhanced RSSI technique with error compensation algorithm to determine the position of users or targeted objects with correct reference points to improve the positioning result.

A BLE beacon can supply information that is related to location. This information is used for many purposes such as e-learning and commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a new style of outdoor studying as a collaboration between outdoor studying and the local economy. Shops in the area supply students with vivid and seasonal information about the area. Over three years of research, we found our application caused students to remember the cultural sites. We also found that they came to value the area. Shop owners hence hope to benefit from this application. However, we also found some tendencies in students' feelings about traveling in this process. This paper describes the results of our research from 2014 to 2016 using BLE beacons in Nikko. We describe several different scenarios using beacons and their results.

By enabling discover devices in the proximity, BLE could support various mobile Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Obviously, device discovery plays an essential role on the trade-off between the number of devices discovered and the energy consumption for a mobile IoT device with a constrained resource. This paper subsequently proposes a smart device discovery mechanism, named sDiscovery, to adaptively adjust scan window and scan interval according to the variant of the environment. In particular, we record the identities of devices discovered during each scan window and find out the redundant ones. Intuitively, a larger number of redundant devices encountered implies a more stable environment. In this case, the number of unknown devices encountered becomes smaller and the scan window can be shortened as well as the scan interval can be enlarged to preserve energy. The simulation results show that sDiscovery outperforms the existing solution and conventional BLE mechanism from the perspective of power saving. Moreover, we verify the correctness of simulation model through experiments in TI CC2540 development board, where a prototype of the protocol is implemented.

We conducted a preliminary experiment with a test application to examine whether BLE-based ID logs can be used to analyze daily social behaviors, such as how a child spent the day with his or her friends. The results suggest that the history of behavior with a child's friends was acquired accurately. Furthermore, the system could detect the period when the user (that is, a child) was with friends or not, and what kind of activity (for example, walking or staying in one place) the user was involved in.

Integration of sub modules like Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump (CP), loop filter, Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and divider result into the PLL block Third order low pass filter is designed as loop filter to reduce magnitude of the reference spur sidebands. True Single Phase Clock (TSPC) architecture is used to design the divider as it has the advantage of a higher operating frequency. It also reduces the power consumption and propagation delay. QPSK modulation technique is incorporated in the proposed design of EDR-BLE transmitter. Power gating technique is handled in power management circuitry to function the modules with low power consumption. It is one of the optimum solutions provided for proper power management. Construction of the transmitter consisted of producing a detailed schematic of each modules constituted in the design. Finally, the output of the schematic design of EDR-BLE transmitter produced a clean signal for both the in-phase and quadrature phase signals. It is visualized with necessary terminologies in the final transient analysis response of the EDR-BLE transmitter.

Until now, health and safety information for specific machinery was commonly held only as paper copies for student reference. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies mean that it is possible to provide highly-localised health and safety information as well as short instructional videos detailing the safe operation of workshop equipment using mobile technology. Each workshop has been equipped with a "learning beacon" - a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon that points mobile devices towards web pages. Students can download the Physical Web app on their mobile device and then use it to access the web page pointed to by the local beacon. The content can be easily updated using Google Sites and the university's own Sharepoint system, making it easy for teaching staff to maintain the content and to add and remove teaching materials as appropriate. Monitoring of the usage of the web pages showed that approximately 25% of the student cohort made use of this resource. This pilot project is a collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity St. David's School of Applied Computing and the School of Applied Art and Design.

Conventional gait analysis is usually used to assist in the treatment of patients in hospitals and is therefore conducted in a specific gait lab or with instruments operated by a medical professional. With conventional approaches, the time and cost involved in experimenting has increased and the accuracy of gait analysis has decreased. Furthermore, the demand to use gait analysis for personal purposes has recently increased. In this paper, a lightweight smart insole is proposed to assist in the analysis of human gait. The proposed lightweight smart insole uses a force sensitive resistor (FSR) array to measure a human step with low power consumption. The step measured by the FSR is used for gait analysis. The data are then converted into meaningful data such as the number of steps, walking velocity, and the distance travelled. The smart insole communicates with the user's smart device through Bluetooth low energy (LE). The smart device records the data in the memory, visualizes the pressure pattern on the display, and then analyzes the user's gait pattern. The method in which the lightweight smart insole system assesses and treats the individual's gait with the Smartphone application is also discussed.

With the increase in a number of thefts, it has become a necessity to implement a smart security system. Due to the high cost of the existing smart security systems which use conventional Bluetooth and other wireless technologies and their relatively high energy consumption, implementing a security system with low energy consumption at a low cost has become the need of the hour. The objective of the paper is to build a cost effective and low energy consumption security system using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This system will help the user to monitor and manage the security of the house even when the user is outside the house with the help of webpage. This paper presents the design and implementation of a security system using PSoC 4 BLE which can automatically lock and unlock the door when the user in the vicinity and leaving the vicinity of the door respectively by establishing a wireless connection between the physical lock and the smartphone. The system also captures an image of a person arriving at the house and transmits it wirelessly to a webpage. The system also notifies the user of any intrusion by sending a message and the image of the intruder to the webpage. The user can also access the door remotely on the go from the website.

On the connectivity side technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, Zigbee etc. are also used. Most common problems faced by developers while developing end applications is interfacing the sensors and actuators, working with IoT Software Development Kits (SDK) like Azure IoT SDK, Amazon AWS SDK and connectivity stacks. Many sensor vendors do provide sensor drivers, but user has to research and access multiple sources to get the necessary information and source code. Developer has to spend efforts in porting or interfacing the driver to his Micro Controller (MCU) platform. Portability also becomes important to protect software investments for future. This paper discusses about SDK for MCUs, Plugins for MCU SDKs, and provides details on how they simplify efforts for the developers in rapidly prototyping IoT end applications.

Nevertheless, there has been no such a device to monitor fetal ECG (fECG) in spite of high fetus mortality rate due to heart diseases. In this work, we present a novel patch using non-contact electrodes (NCEs) to acquire the abdominal ECG (aECG) of the mother which comprises both fECG and maternal ECG (mECG) and a reference patch on mother's chest to extract mECG. The device is based on a polyimide film with NCEs and circuits, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and a flexible Li-polymer battery. A MATLAB algorithm was developed to precisely extract the fECG and mECG using Linear Mean Square (LMS) adaptive filter. The system was characterized and validated using recorded ECG signals and an online database with zero error between Rpeaks of stabilized filter outputs and required signals. Therefore, our aECG and mECG patch hold promise to monitor the wellbeing states of both the fetus and mother in the home setting as well as provide data for early diagnoses of heart diseases even before the baby is born.

Current procedures in firefighting standards require several rehab activities such as measuring body temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG) for prescribed intervals during incidences. In this work, we developed a novel wirelessly powered, non-contact electrode (NCE) bio-potential sensor system with wireless communication for continuous ECG monitoring of firefighters. The system includes a passive flexible NCE ECG unit to be embedded in the base layer of the fire suit and an external unit to carry out wireless power transfer (WPT) via inductive coupling. The battery unit located on the fire entry suit provides power through a class-E amplifier operating at 1 MHz. WPT and real-time ECG acquisition were demonstrated and characterized. Our proposed method can also be implemented to obtain other physiological parameters, such as motions and body temperature, thus holding promise to promote safety of firefighters.

Despite the introduction of multiple standard device-to-device communication protocols (i.e., WiFi direct, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC), transferring data across devices remains hard for mobile programmers for three reasons. 1) different devices support different D2D communication interfaces, and therefore the available D2D communication channels are dynamically decided by the peers; 2) different D2D interfaces have different features (connection establish time, data rate, energy consumption) and different performances under different contexts, complicating the decision which channel to use; 3) implementing and debugging data transmission functionalities requires knowing the low-level details of communication protocols, which is difficult and error prone. To solve the above mentioned problem, this paper presents a runtime framework for context-sensitive device-to-device communication. The presented framework consists of two major components: 1) a set of encapsulated D2D data transmission interfaces to reduce the programming efforts; 2) a context-sensitive communication channel selection algorithm to select the optimal communication channel as defined by the dynamic context. We design and implement the runtime framework, and evaluate its performance in terms of the required programming effort, energy consumption and data transmission latency under different contexts.

A passive linearizer is integrated at the input of the CMOS PA to nullify the effect of the Cgs capacitance thus improving the linearity and efficiency without trading-off the power gain and stability. The PA delivers more than 10dB power gain from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz. At centre frequency of 2.45GHz, the PA exhibits gain of 11.5dB with corresponding PAE of 38.4% and maximum output power of 15dBm followed by OIP3 of 20.3dBm. This performance is achieved with supply voltage headroom of 1.8V. The proposed linearization scheme serves to be a good solution to improve the linear output power of a CMOS PA without trading off other critical parameters.

This paper presents a system that continuously monitors the proper pencil grip and writing activity of kid using accelerometer and pressure sensors. The system creates a labeled dataset for recognizing the correct location of pencil grip, holding direction of the pencil, and writing activity of kids. The system uses a supervised machine learning technique and labeled dataset for classifying whether a kid properly uses a pencil or not. In addition, a prototype system is developed and adequately tested on real-time user data. The prototype uses accelerometer and pressure sensors for extracting the writing activities. The system uses bluetooth low energy for wirelessly transferring the sensed data of writing activities to the parent and teachers. The system is suitable for kids due to its low cost, small size, and low-power consumption.

BluePrint: BLE Positioning Algorithm based on NUFO Detection	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 04-08, 2017	YourSingapore, Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE, Intel, Natl Instruments, Huawei, Keysight Technologies Inc, Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Rohde & Schwarz	YourSingapore			The introduction of the Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard greatly facilitates the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Most of these applications require a positioning mechanism to detect the position of both people and objects. While BLE is a key enabling technology, it is relatively new as compared to Wi-Fi and RFID. Hence there is a need to conduct more studies on BLE-based positioning methods. In general, positioning methods based on signal propagation and fingerprint are commonly used in wireless networking. These methods have their own limitations in terms of practical use and ease of implementation. In this paper, we present an innovative BLE-based positioning methodology called BluePrint which makes use of a detection mechanism called NUFO (Near, Uncertain, Far and Out). It combines a simple fingerprint-like method with a rule-based algorithm to estimate positions. Experimental results show that Blueprint with NUFO detection can achieve good performance as compared to other methods. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical.

Since there exist many wireless technologies operating in this frequency band, the issues of cross-technology interference and coexistence present a major challenge. In this work, we develop a testbed to conduct our experimental studies, focusing on BLE and its coexistence capabilities when being deployed in a dense environment, under possible interference from WiFi and ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4. One scenario of interest is a network of several co-located BLE-based BANs, each of which is designed in a star topology with one gateway and multiple BLE sensor nodes. The second scenario represents a highly heterogeneous network where each BAN now carries both BLE and ZigBee sensors, while being exposed to interference from external WiFi transmission. Our results show that the performance of BLE is relatively robust to interference from other BLE transmissions as well as those from nearby ZigBee and WiFi devices.

Therefore, MEMS positioning has long-time error accumulation. The fingerprint positioning of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is independent of accumulative error, but there is an irregular jump error in the positioning result, which limits the positioning accuracy. Furthermore, the actual commercial positioning systems generally require the consecutive positioning in multi-floor environment. Based on this, this paper proposes a data fusion algorithm based on BLE and MEMS for indoor cross-floor positioning. Firstly, we denoise the fingerprint database by clustering, outlier detection, and filtering algorithms. Then, the extended Kalman filter is employed to complete the optimal estimation of the twodimensional target position according to the robust M estimation. Finally, the barometer and geographical position information are used to achieve the height estimation of the target. This paper also carries out a large number of engineering verification. The experimental results show that the algorithm can suppress the cumulative error effectively caused by low-cost MEMS sensors, and solve the problem of irregular jump error caused by Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) jitter. In the indoor multi-layer environment, the proposed system achieves the horizontal and vertical positioning Root Mean Square (RMS) errors less than 0.9 m and 0.35 m respectively. In addition, we have verified the stability of the designed system through the long-time test.

All communications in BLE networks must involve neighbor discovery process (NDP) in the first place since a BLE device needs to create a connection or exchange information with its neighbors. Thus, the performance of the discovery latency is a challenging issue to be addressed for integrating BLE into the Beacon application development as the number of BLE devices increases. In this paper, we propose a twoway communication with wait-slot scheme (TCWS) to minimize the probability of collision occurring on the response frames of BLE devices and improve the latency of NDP. We formulate the state transition diagram for analyzing the performance of our proposed scheme. The results show that TCWS provides much better performance in terms of the probability of collision and the discovery latency in dense BLE networks.

Verification of Coexistence Measurement Methods: Radiated Anechoic and Open Environment	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY & SIGNAL/POWER INTEGRITY (EMCSI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility and Signal/Power Integrity (EMCSI)	AUG 07-11, 2017	Washington, DC	IEEE				With an abundance of wireless devices saturating daily life, the ability of devices to coexist among other devices is of increasing interest. While standards are starting to incorporate coexistence measurements, the robustness of coexistence measurement methods is still an area of active research. To demonstrate the robustness of the multiple test methods, a series of measurements needs to be conducted that compare a measurement methods. Ideally, if the same coexistence test is performed by use of each of the four methods, the end result should be the same. Here, we compare two popular radiated test methods: an anechoic chamber test and a radiated open-environment test. Both methods are part of the ANSI C63.27 standard. We examine the impact two of the possible environments may have on the outcome of a coexistence test. For this, we use Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi networks. Overviews of generalized coexistence testing and future work are also presented.

Blind spot accidents are a frequently occurring problem. Annually, dozens of deaths are caused by this phenomenon despite legally compulsory prevention tools and large investments in raising awareness and developing prevention systems. Because this is not enough to reduce the number of accidents, proactive solutions must be found. This article describes the evaluation of a new blind spot system based on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In this paper, a complete system is designed with on-the-shelf products and finally realized in a proof-of-concept. The final design requirements are fixed, by figuring out where the blind spots are and which various advantages and disadvantages the existing systems have. In a further stage, the system is tested in several possible critical situations, proving that it is very robust. Vulnerable road users are indeed detected by visualization on the LCD display.

A number of open challenges affect practical deployments, such as simultaneous use of multiple technologies, intelligent coordination of a subset of nodes, coexistence of different technologies using the same spectrum, efficient management of (simultaneously used) heterogeneous radio links, etc. This paper will consider Semantic Technology (ST), as a promising approach to coordination in such complex wireless infrastructures, especially in cases where interference models are not well understood. A Neural Network (NN) will be used for the network state estimation and ST for reasoning about required actions. It is based on semantic data sets mining such that coordination decisions may be driven by predictions instead of using physical spectrum sensing devices. ST facilitates reasoning about coordination, application priority, frequency selection and dynamic spectrum access. Because of capability of the NN to solve regression and classification problems, potentially problematic network states could be proactively avoided instead of reactively corrected particularly in priority critical applications.

World Health Organization (WHO) statistic shows that the mortality rate of hypertension is 9.4 million per year and causes 55.3% of total deaths in cardiovascular (CV) patients [2]. Early detection and prevention of hypertension can significantly reduce the CV mortality. We are presenting a wireless chest wearable vital sign monitoring platform. It measures Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethsmogram (PPG) and Ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals and sends data over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to mobile phone-acts as a gateway. A custom android application relays the data to thingspeak server where MATLAB based offline analysis estimates the blood pressure. A server reacts on the health of subject to friends & family on the social media - twitter. The chest provides a natural position for the sensor to capture legitimate signals for hypertension condition. We have done a clinical technical evaluation of prototypes on 11 normotensive subjects, 9 males 2 females.

In this paper, an implantable LES stimulator with wireless power transmission is proposed for the treatment of GERD. The LES stimulator is composed of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), an external controller, and a wireless power transmission module. The IPG, whose area is 31x21 mm(2), is designed to generate voltage-regulated constant-current stimulation pulses. The external controller allows for wireless programming of the IPG via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. The wireless power transmission module provides power for the IPG. According to the measurement of output stimulus waveforms, the proposed LES stimulator is capable of delivering electrical stimulations with a current ranging between 0 and 8 mA. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the proposed LES stimulator, experiments were performed on 12 male New Zealand white rabbits. Esophageal manometry was performed before and after the procedure and the LES pressure (LESP) has been recorded. The mean LESP is increased significantly in the stimulation group than the sham group (stimulation group: 9.25 +/- 1.24 mmHg vs 13.99 +/- 1.28 mmHg, p<0.05; sham group: 9.00 +/- 1.22 mmHg vs 9.23 +/- 1.27 mmHg, p=0.267). The results show that the electrical stimulation delivered by the LES stimulator can safely and effectively increase resting LES pressure in acute animal models, suggesting that the implantable LES stimulator is a perspective approach for treating GERD in clinics.

In this paper, we report the experience gained from the deployment of a BTLE zone-based positioning system in a retail setting with defined service objectives. The algorithm powering the positioning system requires previous calibration, which comes to be a tedious and long invasive process when it is accomplished in a space with high people flow. The paper describes our work to minimize the calibration effort, by analyzing the effect of calibration samples reduction and proposing the application of a on-the-move calibration strategy that facilitates the calibration dynamics preserving the system's correct recognition rate.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4 are two low-power wireless standards that are widely used in sensor network applications. They share the same unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum. To be able to employ both technologies in the same environment in a heterogeneous network, the creation of a proper coexistence mechanism is imperative. In this paper, we propose and develop a cooperative mechanism for the coexistence of co-located IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE networks in the time domain. This mechanism tries to avoid overlap of communications in these networks in order to decrease the chance of Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) and thus packet drops. The proposed mechanism does not impose any protocol change. The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated by using real hardware devices. The experimental results show that the overall packet reception ratio improves up to 12%.

A key feature of connected car solutions is personalization. An advanced solution shall be able to enable complete personalization for each seat automatically. This paper presents the design and implementation of BlueID - a framework for robust in-car localization and on-demand personalization using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. BlueID identifies a user based on the user's mobile device and characterizes each seat using signals received from a pre-installed BLE beacon array. BlueID features a machine learning engine that can robustly distinguish seats in the presence of various environment and system dynamics such as varied antenna sensitivities and multiple seat occupants. To enable on-demand use cases, BlueID employs a connected car cloud platform to store each vehicle's seat prediction model and each user's personalization profile. The prediction model and the user's personalization profile are retrieved to personalize the environment where the user sits when the user enters the vehicle. We have implemented a prototype of BlueID and evaluated it through extensive experiments. The results show that BlueID achieves satisfactory in-car localization performance with average position accuracy over 98%.

This technology is widely employed to collect patients' vital signs, to provide wireless connectivity to medical equipment, and to enable communications between devices carried by hospital personnel, patients and visitors. This paper presents a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of the interferences, from different wireless technologies, on the performance of a BLE-based body area networks operating over the 1 Mbit/s physical layer (PHY). The interfering technologies addressed are ZigBee (802.15.4), Wi-Fi (802.11), and the newly introduced BLE version 5.0 (coded PHY). The results for the latter are supported by real-life measurements, which are reported in this paper, thus giving some insight into the practical performance of this new technology.

Mesh protocols on top of BLE are currently emerging and the standard is currently being released. This paper first proposes a detailed measurement based comparison of two mesh approaches that fit within BLE operation: flooding and connection oriented networking. Using metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and power consumption we conclude that the optimal mesh approach depends on the application. It is shown that for a comparable performance in terms of PDR and overhead, flooding can trade a lower end-to-end delay for a higher power consumption when compared to the connected mesh. We then propose an architecture, called Bluetooth Now, that is able to automatically switch the network between the two based on message priority. Our measurement results confirm the reliable delivery of important and urgent data sent using the Bluetooth Now paradigm, while saving battery life when transmitting non-time critical messages.

In this work, an optimized indoor positioning approach using BLE for detecting a smart device's location in an indoor environment is proposed. The first stage of the proposed approach is a calibration stage for initialization. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is collected and pre-processed for a stable outcome, in the second stage. Then the distance is estimated by using the processed RSSI and calibrated factors in the third stage. The final stage is the position estimation using the outputs from the previous steps. The positioning technique, which is an improved Least Square estimation is evaluated against the other well-known techniques such as, Trilateration-Centroid, classic Least Square Estimation in estimating the user's location in the 2D plane. Experimental results show that our proposed approach has promising results by achieving an accuracy of positioning within 0.2 to 0.35m.

In order to mitigate interference-related problems, it would be helpful to have a method that determines to which standard a received packet belongs. However, conventional methods do not analyze the actual environment of congestion nor do they classify narrowband signals. In this paper, we propose identification algorithms and an automatic standard classification method that identifies WLAN/IEEE 802.15.4/BT (Bluetooth)/BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), which are considered typical standards in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The results show that the identification algorithms improve detection sensitivities compared to conventional ones, and the proposed method of automatic standard classification accurately analyzed the actual situation where radio waves of plural standards overlap one another.

Typical SDMA scheme requires estimations of channel state information (CSI) using orthogonal pilot sequences. However, the orthogonal pilot is not embedded in the BLE packet. This fact motivates us to apply ICA detector into BLE. In this case, there are three problems to be addressed. First, ICA requires a lot of samples for maintaining the accuracy of signal separation capability. Then, ICA suffers from phase ambiguity. Finally, noise enhancements are caused by ICA detector. To deal with all problems, we propose a unified design of ICA, differential detector, and SIC for SDMA of BLE. Regarding the packet error rate (PER) performance, computer simulations validate the proposed design.

A unique approach to the smart device is the use of low-cost wireless sensors for machine condition measurement. Smartphones may be used as the computational platform that acquires motor parameters from wireless sensors using a compatible local communication. Considering the widespread use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in smartphones, a BLE enabled sensor network was selected for this study. An experimental setup was created to emulate the industrial environment and evaluate the performance of the communication infrastructure for successful deployment of intelligent condition monitoring. The network performance measurements were carried out to assess the BLE performance with several AC and DC machines operated using different loads in a laboratory with many structural obstructions. Also, an optimal placement of a wireless gateway was explored.	[Kande, Mallikarjun] ABB Power Generat, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Meena, P.; Aarathi, R.

The use of BLE in smart sensor and control devices based IoT application has the limitation of range and direct connectivity to internet and thus require use of additional hardware for connecting to internet gateway. This paper proposes a novel architecture using Bluetooth 5 for IoT devices and smart buildings and thus creating a new concept of smart community. Bluetooth 5 has 4 times the range and double the data transfer speed and 8 times broadcasting capacity than its previous version of Bluetooth and thus eliminates the use of additional repeaters for range extension and makes low cost smart buildings a reality.

Information technology needed by the public that is looking for information position and location of destination in the building (indoor positionting). Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.

This technology remains relatively underdeveloped due to the inherent difficulty of geolocalization in an indoor environment. Currently, we are working in an indoor navigation system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons fingerprinting and we created a testbed deployment of 30 beacons in the Center for Information Technologies of ESPOL University. This paper presents a comparison study of three machine learning techniques used to improve BLE fingerprinting accuracy within our testbed. Preliminary results show that Random Forest, 30% more accurate than Naive Bayes, is able to correctly estimate the location of multiple users with room-level accuracy 91% of the time.

Despite the tight relation with the main radio functions, it is usually implemented with separate hardware, firmware, and it is far from being integrated in the most diffused standard wireless protocols for sensors networks and for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we want to check in-deep the coexistence between the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is one of the most used low-power short-range wireless standards for mobile and wearable communication, and a wake-up facility implemented in the same band. We focus on the analysis of the limits, advantages and drawbacks of adding this interesting feature in the BLE standard, and we discuss about the improvements in terms of power saving and latency of the communication. We target IoT applications and scenarios with a high density of BLE devices, analyzing the standard protocol and how WuRs can enhance its performance. Two common communication schemes will help us to show the limits and to define a design methodology for the application. Simulation results will show the trade-offs of the communication performance and the difference from a normal usage of the BLE. Finally, considerations about the usability of BLE with WuRs and guidelines will be provided as concluding remarks.

However, the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we pro pose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC.

There are instances where students are unaware of assignment deadlines and tests which lead to demeaning scores. To bridge this gap, Internet of Things (IOT) can be used to provide academic related information to students. This functionality would help in achieving the goal of zero verbal communication between student and teacher. The teacher can upload assignments and deadlines which will be retrieved by the mobile phone when the student comes in the range of the device. To accomplish this goal, we used Beacon technology which allows Mobile Applications to listen for signals from beacons in the physical world and react accordingly. Strategic and creative location-based technology implementation has great potential to decrease the hassles faced by a student.

Tourists are unable to fetch necessary information that could be required at the time of emergency due to absence or inappropriate mobile network connectivity. Moreover, tourists are often lost and many casualties are recorded because they could not be tracked and help could not reach them in time. The proposed project works aim to provide an economically viable, sustainable and a user-friendly solution to these problems. This project work aims at developing a module along with an app for tourists which would provide them all the required information about nearby places,directions to reach them along with the emergency contact numbers. The information is provided by the kiosk being installed at different places via BLE Technology. App VOYAGER is an user-friendly interface between user and kiosk that enables tracking of tourists thus saving many lives.

SDN-based Service Automation for IoT	2017 IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORK PROTOCOLS (ICNP)	IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	25th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 10-13, 2017	Toronto, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, HUAWEI				Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a personal area wireless network technology that is of increasing importance for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. By design, BLE supports short-range, single-hop communication between a pair of BLE devices. As such, native BLE does not allow network-based policy control or in-network functions for service enhancement. These limitations are impediments to any largescale BLE based IoT deployment (e.g., in hospital environments), where such sophisticated network-based visibility and control may be required. Relying on cloud-based solutions to meet these requirements has many known shortcomings. This paper proposes an SDN-based architecture for enabling wide area IoT deployments using BLE devices at the edge. We introduce a programmable BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. BLESS can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller to enable flexible, policy-based switching, as well as various in-network operations in BLE networks. We describe the design of BLESS, its implementation using P4 and OVS, and illustrate its utility through practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

The authenticity of devices must be protected to prevent cloned or corrupted devices from joining a private network. State-of-the-art systems already provide secured communication links either by a security layer in the interface protocol stack (e.g. the Security Manager Protocol in Bluetooth Low Energy) or by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol on top of the interface protocol. These solutions have in common that they only protect the communication links. Thus the system is still vulnerable to active and passive physical attacks that aim to clone the device or to extract the used keys. We show an approach with off-the-shelf security trust anchors that allows securing a device against such attacks. The proposed solution allows product authentication with low-cost ready-to use components which can be easily integrated in an architecture similar to existing proposals. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by presenting a prototype implementation and discuss performance and security implications. The results indicate that the proposed architecture provides reasonable security at acceptable costs and can serve as template for many applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) context.

Although there is a significant amount of research targeting indoor localization technologies and their performance, most of these efforts only focus on theory, system design or evaluation in non-industrial environments, usually offices or healthcare spaces. In this work, a detailed performance evaluation of two commercially available accurate localization technologies, based on Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB), in an industrial environment is presented to create an experimental understanding of their behaviour in similar conditions and to investigate their potential to be used in industrial applications with concrete localization requirements. For this purpose, these localization technologies are examined with respect to various performance criteria in several scenarios in a real industrial site.

While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real effects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd offers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. This paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-specified goals, but does so more efficiently than analogous configurations of competing protocols.

The BLE beacon broadcasts BLE advertisement while people are in motion. A beacon receiver (BR) was installed in a room near the doorframe to deteimine people's movements (i.e., entering, departing, or passing by the room), based on the variations in received signal strength (RSS) over lime. This system is aimed at providing tracking information for people in school buildings, hospitals, and nursing homes. Knowing in which room or area people are has many useful applications, and the system is low-cost and easy to install and maintain.

It consists in a Bluetooth Low Energy rings enabling wireless communication with any compatible device. Each ring is hardware-wise independent of the others. This allows full modularity, i.e., the number of employed devices can he chosen to meet each application requirements. The proposed system was evaluated in two user studies, both on text input: (1) users learning curve in terms of writing speed; (2) rate of text entry comparison between the proposed interface and that of numpad style keyboards. We associated each keystroke to a set of letters/symbols and compared two approaches: one based on T9 technique and the other on multi-tap input method. Results show comparable performance between HAT and numpad style keyboards. HAT keeps the hands free, not affecting hand movements and human interactions with the surroundings. Moreover, as a general input technology, it might have several potential applications in the field of computer-human interfaces.

Navigating free of signal reception problems throughout a building when one has never visited that place before is a challenge tackled with indoors localization. Using Bluetooth Low Energy(1) (BLE) beacons (either iBeacon or Eddystone formats) is the medium to accomplish that. Indeed, different purpose oriented applications can be designed, developed and shaped towards the needs of any person in the context of a certain building. This work presents a series of post-processing filters to enhance the outcome of the estimated position applying trilateration as the main and straightforward technique to locate someone within a building. A later evaluation tries to give enough evidence around the feasibility of this indoor localization technique. A mobile app should be everything a user would need to have within a building in order to navigate inside.

Such systems should take advantage of the large amount of wireless networks and radio interfaces already incorporated in most mobile consumer devices. Among the existing radio interfaces, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 is called to play a major role in the deployment of energy efficient ubiquitous services. In this paper, we first show that the high sensitivity of BLE4.0 to fast fading makes infeasible the use of radio propagation models to directly estimate the distance between a reference transmitter and the mobile device. We then explore the use of supervised learning algorithms towards the development of radio maps of beacons analysing in-depth two metrics accuracy and mean error. Our approach also explores two main parameters: (i) Transmission power (Tx) of the BLE4.0 beacons; and (ii) Physical characteristics of the area. Based on our results, we argue that the mean error can be improved up to 28% configuring the two main parameters.

The basic requirements of the indoor positioning system are high accuracy, availability, and cost and energy efficiency. Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based iBeacon along with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system meets the aforementioned requirements. For iBeacon based indoor positioning, path-loss model is adopted to calculate the distance between user and iBeacon, and the maximum likelihood estimate positioning method is proposed for positioning. In the PDR positioning system, the Mahony Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) is adopted to calculate the attitude of smart phone, in order to improve the performance of heading inference. Because of the presence of error accumulation over time in PDR based positioning system, along with the fact that the iBeacon based positioning system is susceptible to disturbance, we proposed an integration algorithm for iBeacon and PDR using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Experiments indicates that the proposed method can achieve a meter-level precision.

For example, a group of tourists may be monitored by a tour operator to keep the group together and on schedule. Alternatively, a group of elementary school children in transit to school should be closely supervised by an adult to ensure the children stay safe. This paper presents LASSO, a smartphone-based service that exploits wireless devices carried by each group member to provide infrastructure-free group formation and monitoring. We show how smartphones equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be used as personal beacons in a device-to-device group monitoring protocol to allow each user to join a group and see a distributed view of group membership in real time. While LASSO is general purpose in nature, we demonstrate it and evaluate its performance through a prototype application used by a tourist guide to monitor tour participants.

Despite the increasing number of IoT devices and the improving performance of BLE, the usage model is still limited to point-to-point with no mobility. This limitation prevents the devices to spread across a large field or a home. While multi-hop technologies had been studied and commercialized, they do not fully take advantage of the BLE's low-power feature; and their configurations cannot easily be changed once the network is deployed. We have designed an architecture called BlueSkyNet. It allows network administrators to form and manage a BLE multi-hop network that allows nodes to be mobile. It takes advantage of the improving performance of BLE, and allows the network configurations to be modified in a software-defined way.

GFSK modulation is also widely used, because of its excellent power utilization and spectrum utilization. Compared to GFSK analog modulation, digital GFSK modulation is lower in the bit error rate. In this paper, the digital GFSK modulation is studied, and the GFSK modulation scheme is proposed and simulated by MATLAB, which is suitable for Low Power Bluetooth baseband chip.

Smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is one of the widely-adopted localization techniques with limiting problems such as the drift of inertial sensors. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has better performance result which makes it an auxiliary tool for PDR to correct errors. But BLE fingerprint sampling and calibrating are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm based crowdsourcing method is developed and applied to generate BLE landmarks instead of manual work leveraging smartphone sensors and uploaded BLE signals. A particle filter is also used to fusion PDR and landmarks detection results for better localization performance. The experiments show that the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.15 m at 90% of the time with dense landmarks (1 landmark per 5 m), which performs 51.76% better than 6.53 m from PDR algorithm. With sparse landmarks (1 landmark per 15 m), the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.26 m at 90% of the time. The proposed tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors and BLE beacons can be a promising methodology in practical usages.

Especially, smart wristbands are booming in the market recently, which can be used to monitor health status, track fitness data, or even do medical tests, etc. For this reason, smart wristbands can obtain a lot of personal data. Hence, users and manufacturers should pay more attention to the security aspects of smart wristbands. However, we have found that some Bluetooth Low Energy based smart wristbands have very weak or even no security protection mechanism, therefore, they are vulnerable to replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, brute-force attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, etc. We have investigated four different popular smart wristbands and a smart watch. Among them, only the smart watch is protected by some security mechanisms while the other four smart wristbands are not protected. In our experiments, we have also figured out all the message formats of the controlling commands of these smart wristbands and developed an Android software application as a testing tool. Powered by the resolved command formats, this tool can directly control these wristbands, and any other wristbands of these four models, without using the official supporting applications.

Recent researches show that Wi-Fi module in smartphones could be used to improve the traffic safety by broadcasting pedestrian position data. However, these Wi-Fi-based schemes could not achieve two-way communication with low latency, which would seriously affect the user experience. To address this issue, we propose an Android application called BLE-Horn, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to realize the bidirectional many-to-many communications. What's more, BLE also has advantages like lower battery consumption, low latency, low cost and it is also widely supported by smartphones. We redefine a Compressed GPS Information Packet (CGIP) in Bluetooth advertising packets and use a collision warning algorithm to detect the potential collision. In the real road test, we show that BLE-Horn can support at least 5 devices to communicate simultaneously between each other. The measured communication latency is as low as 56ms. With BLE-Horn running for an hour in the background, the battery level drops off only by 8.2 percents.

It is designed to work inside a culture chamber performing impedance measurement in the frequency range of 64Hz to 200KHz. The board is equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module allowing it to be wirelessly controlled. The software interface (also called ISMI) is coded with all required functionalities to manage the parameters of the board such as start frequency and sweep, measuring intervals, data acquisition and visualization and also a function to perform automatic measuring between desired time intervals during whole day for many days. In addition, the electrodes used for the measurements of cells are characterized giving an impedance magnitude between 103 to 105 ohms in a frequency range of 300Hz to 100KHz and a maximum voltage without considerable electrode deterioration of 120mVpeak. This information is used in the calibration of the ISMI system giving a measurement accuracy above 98% when compared with simulation results and with a reference instrument. The proposed system is an introductory step in the study of cells related to fibrous tissue induced by implants showing to be a viable and reproducibility-improving approach for such analysis. This first prototype provides information regarding the requirements for the design of an integrated version for embedded applications.

Its value is currently monitored by performing few measurements per day, acquired through heel pricks or arterial samplings. Unfortunately, the frequency of those samplings is quite low in preterm newborns, who are very low birth weight infants, due to their fragility. As a result, hyper-or hypo-glycemia events occurring between two separate measurements remain often unnoticed. A medical research group working at the University Hospital of Padova already proved the clinical benefits of continuous glucose monitoring for preterm newborns hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, glucose data are still sampled through individual devices that are not integrated into a central monitoring system. Thus the health care staff has to visit regularly the cradles, watch the glycemia trends and pay attention to alarms. Our contribution deals with the implementation of a system based on mobile technologies that sends the data acquired through commercial glucometers to a central database, so that they become available in real time for the staff in the ward room. Moreover, we also integrated into that system an algorithm described in the literature for recommending the most appropriate glucose infusion rates based on the last readings of the patient. The system runs on an Android device and has been successfully tested in two different clinical trials involving twelve and five patients respectively.

In this context, the Internet of Things technologies could allow to analyze the elderly's behavioral in an unobtrusive way, thus helping to prevent Mild Cognitive Impairment and frailty problems. To this end, this work aims to define a reliable system for controlling the position and the body motility of the elderly in low-cost and low-power way. Movements and body motility are, indeed, good indicators of behavioral changes. The system represents the basis of a complete architecture for behavioral analysis and risk detection developed within the City4Age project, funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission.

Previous wireless portable systems were not able to collect and analyze the plantar pressure from both feet simultaneously. In this study, the multi-connection capability of CC2650 Bluetooth low energy (BLE) chip from Texas Instruments was utilized to construct the pressure sensor insoles system. A smart phone application was implemented to receive, store and display the pressure information from both feet. This system can identify the gait cycle and pressure distribution which can be used to assist the physicians or coaches during training.

The solution is based on combining a decoy with a real system, where a BLE controller will be placed in the middle, acting like a fob that opens and closes the access of the server's BLE. If the first server wants to communicate with the second server, the BLE must be activated by the BLE controller in order for both servers to communicate with one another. This is a relatively low-cost solution and our aim is to lower the interruption to the live system, capture the attacker's position, and limit the damages the attacker can do to a live system. A second related goal is to lower the attacker's opportunity to detect that they are being monitored. A third goal is to gather evidence of the attacker's actions that can be used for further investigation. This work is significant in that it is implemented within a real physical system for testing and evaluation using Raspberry PI and Arduino boards to replicate servers that communicate wirelessly. Several custom programs are written from scratch to monitor the attacker's behaviour, and the use of Bluetooth Low Energy to verify users. When the device was disassembled, all of the Raspberry PI, which run the Linux servers, were discontinued and unable to communicate with other devices.	[Wong, Kenneth C.

Therefore, this research investigates if users can be identified without them carrying any devices or keys. In recently years, the device-free techniques using wireless signals instead of sensors and devices on body show the great potential in human detection and identification. In this paper, we present the REDoorGuard, a wireless, invisible and device-free door access system that leverage RSSI signals from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons to recognize the person who accesses the door. We evaluate REDoorGuard in two real scenarios with a total of 16 users: the first is an office room with the key lock, and the second is a meeting room with swipe card access. We exploit the characteristics of the door access and propose a two-step algorithm. We demonstrate that RFDoorGuard is capable of recognizing user actions and identifying the actual user during door access with the accuracy of 95% to 53% from a group of 2 to 10 people respectively.

To address these issues, this paper presents an interactive framework, Notify-and-Interact, which leverages the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure to notify and a smart-phone to interact, such that it transforms a passive interactive system into an active one. The proposed framework is demonstrated in the Ping Yuan and Kinmay W Tang Gallery, where a series of wildlife artworks are exhibited. Engagement conversion rate is measured, and users' quality of experience (QoE) is surveyed through likert assessment. Artworks with Notify-and-Interact outperforms the QR code with a high engagement conversion rate at the interaction stage, i.e., 86% over 53%, and an average engagement time of 55.67s over 28.69s, respectively. The mean opinion score (MOS) shows that around 80% of the users expressed high satisfaction with the installed Notify-and-Interact framework in the gallery.

Two factor authentication schemes such as Google 2 Step verification, SAASPASS, QR code, graphical password and push notification based login schemes can be compromised using RT / CR MITM phishing attacks. Hardware token based schemes are safe but the extra cost of the hardware token makes them unattractive to users. Therefore, there is a need to develop new authentication schemes which are hard for an attacker to compromise but easy for users to understand and utilize. This paper analyzes existing authentication schemes to identify the research gaps and then proposes a secure authentication scheme which uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE, BT 4.0+ version) devices for user identification and which can handle RT/CR MITM phishing attacks, attacks launched via malicious browser extensions and app spoofing via attackers. The proposed scheme is location/client system independent and is secure from Bluetooth address spoofing attacks.

With the use of extrusion-based 3D printers, we produced a model that printed both the resistive circuits and a complete insole simultaneously. These distinctive technologies have given us the capability to capture valuable pressure data from the insole of the foot. Analog signals sent from the pressure sensor arrays are received and processed through an attached multiplexer designed specifically for this application. The signal is then digitized and transmitted over the SPI to a micro controller via Bluetooth Low Energy, to an android device to allow the user to easily record and interpret the pressure data in real-time. The android device houses a pressure mapping view to show the gradient of force throughout the insole.

By using the method, we can analyze the behavior of the attendees at some large-scale exhibition, such as the order of the visited booth and the duration of the stay. Using mobile BLE tags has some advantages: to collect a large amount of data easily, to provide location estimation without smart phones. However, in a real environment. the BLE signal is unstable due to many people and obstacles. Fingerprinting is difficult because arranging booths finishes few hours before exhibition starts. Our previous trilateration method resulted in 10-30 meter accuracy with the data collected at Geospatial EXPO 2015 because of packet loss. We, to decrease packet loss, have developed tandem scanner that is equipped with multiple Bluetooth adapters. This paper presents the result of the improved method with the data collected by tandem scanners at Geospatial EXPO 2016. We also examined what improves accuracy: shorter advertising interval of the BLE tag and a larger number of tandem scanner's available adapters. Average location estimation accuracy was 4.51 meters when using best settings.

The present research has collected characteristics of gestures and physical movements from users made by other related research in order to study the same interaction within a virtual world. Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created, improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture, composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices, and a Smartphone acting as a server, the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR, tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination. By performing maneuvers through an aerial circuit filled with obstacles, the proposed UAV simulator encourages motor and mental activity while the user is being entertained. The result is the improvement of the user quality of life by avoiding cognitive and physical sedentarism.

It has transformed its techniques by using intelligent gadgets that can be acquainted with patients in different configurations. The data obtained from devices like pulse rate monitors, weighing scales, blood glucose measuring devices, etc. is to be stocked and tracked as awareness of health statistics is vital for all. A hefty portion of these measures requires a follow-off with a specialist. This commences the preference of using IoT based smart devices to deliver more valuable data to the patient and drop off the necessity for direct patient-doctor interaction. Improving the standard of service, it brings particularly high value for the patients requiring constant supervision and quick data access and analysis. This paper will demonstrate automatic communication between the smart devices and android mobile application via Bluetooth and data storage on Cloud. Also, it shows automatic control over oxygen cylinder using mobile app for admitted patients who require supplementary oxygen. Thus, our system serves the purpose of minimizing doctors' efforts and providing seamless experience to the patient with IoT, Cloud and Wireless Technology like Bluetooth helping in saving millions of lives.

Among the various protocol standards defined for IoT physical layer Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising one owing to its low power consumption. In this paper, a Viterbi algorithm based BLE receiver is proposed where a joint Viterbi detector and decoder is used rather than using two distinct Viterbi processors for detection and decoding. The proposed model is simulated using Scilab and from the simulation results it is evident that the BER requirement of BLE is met at a SNR value of 5dBm. The performance of the Viterbi algorithm based BLE receiver is found to be superior to other demodulation schemes used. The performance of BLE receiver using joint Viterbi detector and decoder is on par with the receiver model using two Viterbi processors.	[Nimisha, K.

A type of wireless device that has become very popular in the past years has been the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon. This compact, battery-powered device can enable location-based and proximity services across indoor spaces. Several indoor positioning techniques have been explored to achieve indoor localization using these wireless devices. One of these techniques is the fingerprinting technique, which requires careful collection of training data at known locations. We developed an app to facilitate and expedite the process of collecting training data with iOS devices. The training data is collected by our app and saved in the cloud for future retrieval. We collected training data from different floor maps, performed initial analysis on this data, and tested a fingerprinting algorithm in order to provide indoor localization. We developed several tools to evaluate and visualize the training data and tested our indoor localization algorithm in a real-time scenario.

Consisting of an Energy Harvester (EH), an electric current sensor, a Micro-controller Unit (MCU), and a wireless communication device, the proposed system is self-powered and non-invasive, which provides a promising solution as a node in a wireless sensor network. In this work, a customized interface circuitry is designed to collect and regulate the energy from the EH. A Wireless MCU is programmed to acquire, process, and transmit the data from the sensor to the central hub via Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. The real-time data obtained can be used to measure the amount of power consumed by individual appliances within the building. In this paper, the system design and testing results are reported. Attached to an electric wire carrying currents in the range of 7.6A to 30A, the state-of-the-art system can achieve a read-transmit duty cycle from <1min to 2.5min. The unit is capable of reading a 60 HZ AC sensor signal with a peak voltage in the range of 100 mV to 900 mV with an accuracy of 91.4%.

This paper exploits the interaction between Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon and smartphone to set forth the fundamental building block of a beacon-based PBS system. In real-world scenarios, a beacon-based PBS system might suffer from sparse conditions when some beacons malfunction or beacons can only be deployed in a few specific positions. Motivated by such limitations, a similarity filter extended with compressive sampling matching pursuit (SF-CoSaMP) is proposed to ensure the reliability of proximity detection under such sparse conditions before smartphone proceed to retrieve the corresponding PBS. An extensive simulation with large volume of collected data has been conducted and the results prove the reliability of the proposed algorithm with high detection accuracy in an environment with sparse deployment.

The customer's requirement will increase day by day. Online shopping is mostly preferred by almost all over the world. But it is time consuming. Also from which site online shopping is done it is not feasible to customer as distance wise. To overcome this problem we are going to develop "Smart Shoppe Using Beacon". The goal of this research is to implement mobile based indoor positioning shopping application with the beacon solution based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. For estimate the locations based on localizations we use RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). A triangulation algorithm is used for calculate the current location of mobile phone. Beacons provide accuracy in proximity and distance estimation. In our application customer saves their time because customer's gets notifications on mobile phone when they are pass through any malls or stores. When customer like any notification they react on that and they got the way to reach that store. Customer enters into store and get notification about nearer product. In form of notification they get discounts, offers, price, description, colors and reviews of previous customer. Customer can buy any product using application and pay the bill using mobile wallet.

In particular, this paper leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons to realize a PBS system which comprises a number of Proximities of Interest (Pots). We define a PoI as an object or area which is associated with a beacon such that each PoI can announce their presence implicitly through the beacon's signal. However, under a sparse beacon network condition in which some beacons associated with some Pots are malfunction or their batteries die before the scheduled maintenance, a receiver (e.g., smartphone) might fail to return the target PoI correctly. In view of the quality degradation in consequence to the sparse condition, we refine the performance of classical compressive sensing based algorithm with a generalized similarity filter. The effects of different similarity measures on proximity detection performance are also investigated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the detection accuracy as compared to the conventional compressive sensing based algorithm. Specifically, Chordal-based similarity filter achieves substantial improvement in comparison with Mahalanobis and Euclidean-based similarity computation.

It is becoming increasingly relevant for vehicles to become aware of their surroundings. Therefore, having knowledge of nearby Bluetooth devices, both inside and outside other vehicles, can provide the listening vehicles with enough data to learn about their environment. In this paper, we collect and analyze a dataset of Bluetooth Classic (BC) and Low Energy (BLE) discoveries. We evaluate their respective characteristics and ability to provide context-aware information from a vehicular perspective. By taking a look at data about the encountered devices, such as GPS location, quantity, quality of signal and device class information, we infer distinctive behaviors between BC and BLE relative to context and application. For this purpose, we propose a set a features to train a classifier for the recognition of different driving environments (i.e. road classes) from Bluetooth discovery data alone. Comparing the performance of our classifier with different sampling parameters, the presented results indicate that, with our feature selection, we are able to predict with reasonable confidence up to three classes (Highway, City, Extra-Urban) by using only discovery data and no geographical information. This outcome gives promising results targeted at low energy and privacy-friendly applications and can open up a wide range of research directions.
